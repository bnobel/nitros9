* note the name here. DI1024, DIS512 and DI256 are DISTO DRIVERS of various
* sector sizes. TC1024, TCC512 and TCCCHD are the equivalents for the TC3 host
* adapter. DBHSHD for 256 byte/sector st506 style external controllers which
* require handshaking on each byte of a data transfer (i.e. adaptec). DIDBHS
* for the same thing with a DISTO host adapter.
