*   CoCo XT Hard Disk Driver  07/25/87
*
*   For Western Digital WD1002-WX2 (or WX1) Controller.
*
*   This is a general purpose driver.  It can handle
*   1-2 hard drives, the parameters of which are described
*   in the device descriptors.  The drives may be of
*   different sizes.  This version is optimized for the
*   CoCo 2 under level 1, version 2 OS9.  It does not mess 
*   with the clock speed -- the native speed is used.  It 
*   also verifies disk writes, and uses read caching.
