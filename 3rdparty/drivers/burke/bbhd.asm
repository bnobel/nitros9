*   CoCo XT Hard Disk Driver  Version 2.0
*   (with formatting capability)
*
*
*   For Western Digital WD1002-WX2 (or WX1) Controller.
*
*   This version is optimized for ONE hard drive having 4
*   heads and 32 sectors per track.  There is no formatting
*   capability and no write verification.
*
*   The number of tracks is taken from the device descriptor,
*   so this driver can be used with ST-506, ST-412, ST-225 or 
*   ST-238 drives.  This version DOES include the read cache.
*   It has the cruddy error messages.
