     SUMMARY   

          Clean up UUCP spool and log directories 

     DESCRIPTION   

          UUCLEAN is used to clean up old files in the UUCP spool 
          directory.  This directory is defined by the parameter 'spooldir' 
          in the /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters file.  UUCLEAN can also be used to 
          delete files in any other directory based upon the number of days 
          old the files are.  

          UUCLEAN looks through the spool directory of each system for 
          files over a certain age.  All files older than this are 
          deleted.  UUCLEAN also rotates the UUCP and FileServ log files in 
          /DD/LOG. The current day's log file 'uulog' is moved to 
          'uulog.1'. The previous 'uulog.1' moves to 'uulog.2', etc.  The 
          original 'uulog.7' is removed.  A new 'uulog' is create for the 
          new day's files.  

          The FileServ log files are rotated in a similar manner.  The 
          current day's file tranfer log 'fileserv' is moved to 
          'fileserv.1' and so.  The oldest log file, fileserv.7, is 
          removed.  A new 'fileserv' is created for the new day's log.  If 
          the file server is not active (see PARAMETERS.DOC), there is no 
          rotating of FileServ's logs.  

          When UUCLEAN finds a data (D.) file in the spool directory which 
          must be deleted, it attempts to return a copy of the unsent mail 
          to the original sender.  














                                                                           




     UUCLEAN                                                        UUCLEAN


     OPTIONS   

            -n <days>    Delete all files whose age is older than <days> 
                         days old.  The default is 7 days.  

            -d <dir>     Delete files which reside in the directory <dir> 
                         instead of the default directory given by the 
                         'spooldir' parameter.  WARNING--This option must 
                         be used with EXTREME caution.  It is possible to 
                         delete ANY files in ANY directory if they are old 
                         enough.  As a safety measure, only the superuser 
                         can run UUCLEAN.  

            -l           Prevent rotating the uulog files in /DD/LOG. Used 
                         mostly when removing old files from directories 
                         other than the 'spooldir' directories or when 
                         removing old spool files at a time when you do not 
                         want the log files rotated.  

            -v           Turns on the verbose mode.  UUCLEAN will print all 
                         its actions to the standard output as it runs.  

            -x           Turns the debug mode on.  UUCLEAN will print, to 
                         the standard output, all actions it WOULD have 
                         taken without actually deleting any files or 
                         rotating the log files.  


          A task scheduler such as CRON or MCRON typically runs UUCLEAN 
          once a day.  UUCLEAN can be run manually with the debug option to 
          see what actions would take place..ed 

     RESTRICTIONS   

          Only the superuser can run UUCLEAN. In this capacity, no file is 
          safe from being deleted if it is old enough.  Be careful when 
          running UUCLEAN on directories other than the UUCP spool 
          directories.  

          UUCLEAN uses the OS-9 utility RENAME when rotating the log 
          files.  This utility must available either in memory or the 
          current execution directory.  




          UUCLEAN was originally written by Mark Griffith to work with his 
          OS-9 UUCP suite.  Thanks to Mark for his okey-dokey to modify it 
          to work with the UUCPbb package.
