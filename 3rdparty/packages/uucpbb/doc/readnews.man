     SUMMARY   

          Usenet news reader 

     DESCRIPTION   

          The READNEWS command is used to read the news articles.  It 
          maintains a file ./<homedir>/<user>/UUCP/newsrc 
          (./<homedir>/<user>/.newsrc under OSK) to keep track of which 
          articles you have already seen.  It will tell you how many 
          articles remain to be read in each newsgroup, if any, and give 
          you an opportunity to read them.  The characters "y", "n" and "q" 
          are recognized as meaning "yes, read this newsgroup or article 
          now", "no, skip this newsgroup or article and go to the next 
          one", and "quit".  

          The "f" command can also be used to post a followup article to 
          the article you just read.  The article subject, etc, are read 
          from the article, and postnews is executed to post your followup 
          article to the newsgroup being read.  

          At any prompt in readnews, you may type "h" to get a list of all 
          available commands for that prompt.  



          COMMANDS 

          There are different commands possible depending on what you are 
          doing in readnews.  

          When you are at the beginning of a newsgroup, you will see a 
          prompt that looks like this: 

              61 article unread in newsgroup ba.test--read now? [yncq]















                                                                           




     READNEWS                         UUCP                         READNEWS


          These commands are available:
          
               SPACE       Read unread articles in this newsgroup
               c           Catch-up, marking all articles as read
               d           Directory of groups
               g <group>   Goto newsgroup
               h/?         Help (display available commands)
               n           No, skip this group
               q           Quit
               s <group>   Subscribe to newsgroup <group>
               u [<group>] Unsubscribe from the newsgroup <group>
                             default is current newsgroup
               y           Yes, read unread articles


          While you are displaying an article, a "--MORE--" prompt may 
          display if the article is too big to fit on one screen.  You may 
          use any of these commands at that point: 

               SPACE     Show next screen
               n         Skip to next article
               c         Catch-up (mark all articles as read)
               p         Skip to previous article
               s <file>  Save article to <file>
               w <file>  Save article to <file>
                           without header
               v/.       Redisplay current article
               u         Redisplay current article rot13'd (unrot)
               q         Quit displaying article 
               h         Help (display available commands)


          After the article is displayed, you will see a prompt that looks 
          like this: 

              End of article 516 (of 513-580)--What now?  [nq] 

          You may then use any of these commands: 

               a         Add new article in current group
               s <file>  Save article in <file>
               w <file>  Save article in <file> without header
               p         Skip to previous article
               c         Catchup (mark all articles read) 
               f         Followup (post followup article)
               r         Reply to article author via email
               q         Quit
               v/.       Redisplay current article
               n         Skip to next article
               #         Display article #
               u         Redisplay current article rot13'd (unrot)
               h         Help (displays available commands)
               !         Fork a shell
