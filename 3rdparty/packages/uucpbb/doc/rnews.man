     PROGRAM   

          cnvrtmail

     CALLING SEQUENCE: 

          rnews [opts] <filename>
          
          opts: -xN        - N is debug level 0 (off) to 9 (highest)
                -n<group>  - article to newsgroup <group>

     SUMMARY:   

          Process received Usenet newsgroups.  

     DESCRIPTION:   

          RNEWS is rarely run by a user.  It is normally forked by UUXQT 
          which usually runs after UUCICO completes a call.  

          The newsgroups can be batch compressed, batched or unbatched.  If 
          they are batch compressed, the utility COMPRESS (for .Z files) 
          must be available in either in memory or in the execution 
          directory.  

          RNEWS will uncompress the news file, if necessary.  It will then 
          attempt to move each article to the appropriate newsgroup's 
          directory in the news spool directory.  If there is no directory 
          for the particular newsgroup, the article is put in the news 
          directory 'junk'.  

          When processing news, RNEWS attempts to use the RAM disk if it 
          normally has enough free space to fit the article.  If the 
          article is too large for the RAM disk, the directory specified by 
          the parameter 'scratchbig' in /DD/SYS/Parameters is used.  RNEWS 
          does not check for a disk-full error on either the RAM disk or 
          the 'scratchbig' directory.  The user must ensure the free space 
          exists when RNEWS is running.  If the disk fills up, the article 
          may be partially or completely lost.  

     BUGS   

          Debug messages may be a little too plentiful.
