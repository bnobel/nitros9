     SUMMARY:  

          Add user to or remove user from the system

     DESCRIPTION:   

          ADDUSER is used to add a new user or remove a current user from 
          the system with a minimum of input from the system administrator 

          When adding a user to the system a new entry is created in the 
          /DD/SYS/password file for the new user as is a mail and home 
          directory.  A user login file, <username>.login, is created in 
          /DD/LOG. Next, the user's login script 'ulogin' is created in the 
          user's home directory.  ADDUSER will ask if you wish to create a 
          customized ulogin script or use the default version.  If you 
          choose to create a customized script, ADDUSER will prompt you for 
          the entries.  

          If the command line contains no arguments, ADDUSER will prompt 
          you for the username and then a user ID number.  You may choose a 
          user ID or allow ADDUSER to pick the lowest unused user ID.  
          Specifying -s on the command line allows ADDUSER to consider 
          super user ID's if there is room; otherwise, user IDs above the 
          super user range will be considered.  (OS-9/68K systems can have 
          256 super users, from 0.0 to 0.255). If ADDUSER is allowed to 
          choose the user ID, it will pick the lowest unused ID.  

          If the command line contains a user name, ADDUSER will use this 
          name and prompt for the user's ID.  

          If the command lines contains both name and user ID, ADDUSER will 
          use these.  

          In all cases, ADDUSER will inform you if the name or ID is 
          already being used and prompt to try again.  

          When removing a user, ADDUSER will remove the password file 
          entry, the /DD/LOG/<username>.login file as well as the user home 
          and mail directories.  All files and subdirectories in the user's 
          home and mail directories will be deleted as well.  





                                                                           




     ADDUSER                          UUCP                          ADDUSER


     RESTRICTIONS   

          Only the superuser (user ID 0) can use this utility 

     BUGS   

          The removing a user feature is not implemented yet.  

          If ADDUSER aborts because of an error, you will probably need to 
          manually remove the user's password file entry as well as the 
          user's /DD/LOG/<user>.login as well the home and mail directories 
          entries before trying again.  If you don't, ADDUSER may tell you 
          the user already exists.

          This program was original written by Mark Griffith for his OS-9 
          UUCP package.  Thanks to Mark for his okay-dokey to modify the 
          code to work with this UUCP package as well.
