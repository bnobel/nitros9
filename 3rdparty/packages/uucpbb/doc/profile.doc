     SUMMARY:   

          Pseudo-environment variables file for the CoCo.  

     DESCRIPTION:   


          Since OS-9 Level 2 on the CoCo does not yet have true environment 
          variables, UUCPbb attempts to emulates them.  The file 'profile' 
          contains the system and user's environment variables.  

          The file /DD/SYS/profile contains the system default values.  
          Each user can also set some of the environment variables by 
          creating a file 'profile' in their root home (login) directory.  

          If the user's profile exists, it will override the system 
          profile.  If it doesn't the system defaults are used.  

          The file consists of one declaration per line with the format: 

               variable=value 

          There can be no space between on either '='. At present, the UUCP 
          package only supports the variables: TERM, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, and 
          EDITOR. For example: 

               TERM=coco3
               HOME=/dd/usr
               MAIL=/h1/spool/mail
               EDITOR=ved
               SHELL=shell+

          In the case of SHELL, the value 'shell+' is suggested when 
          referring to Shell+ v2.1 or later; while 'shell' refers to the 
          original Microware Shell. Programs will have to internally figure 
          how to make use of the shell environment if the system uses both 
          Shell+ and the MW Shell or another shell.  

          The user is allowed only to change the variables TERM, EDITOR and 
          SHELL in their profile.  The variables HOME and MAIL are reserved 
          only for /DD/SYS/profile. If they appear in the user's profile, 
          they are ignored.  If HOME is not defined in the system profile, 
          getenv() will use the password to try and determine the HOME 
          environment of the user.
