     SUMMARY   

          This file contains user settings for Mailx and news.  

     DESCRIPTION   

          Each entry in this file is on a separate line and follows the 
          syntax.  --NOTE--: There must be at least one space on both sides 
          of the '=': 

               parameter = value 


          The case (upper or lower) of the parameter is ignored.  Lines 
          beginning with '#' <space>, <tab>, or a carriage return are 
          comment lines and ignored.  The parameters which the user can set 
          are: 

          realname     - The user's real name, to be included in message 
                         and news article headers.  If the name is more 
                         than one word, it MUST be surrounded by double 
                         quotes as shown in the example below.  

          editor       - This specifies the editor invoked by the tilde 
                         command ~e when composing message or news 
                         article.  Specify only the name if command will be 
                         in the current execution directory.  Otherwise, 
                         specify a full path.  This value will override the 
                         environment variable EDITOR. There is no default 
                         value; 

          auto_rot     - Specify on (or yes), or off (or no).  The default 
                         value is off (no). If on (yes) is set, news 
                         articles with the keyword rot13 will be 
                         automatically unrot13'd when read.  

          cc_prompt    - Specify on (or yes), or off (or no).  The default 
                         is off (no). If on (yes) is set, the user will be 
                         prompted "Cc: " to send a carbon copy of each 
                         message to one or more addresses.  

          organization - When sending news articles, this line specifies 
                         the Organization: field in the article header.  If 
                         the name of the organization is longer than one 
                         word, it MUST be enclosed in double quotes.  An 
                         organization specified in the system-wide 
                         /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters file will override this 
                         setting.  





                                                                           




     mailrc                           UUCP                           mailrc


          quote        - This is the default quote character which will be 
                         appended to the beginning of each line by Mailx or 
                         POSTNEWS when the tilde command ~m is used.  Only 
                         a single character not a string of characters is 
                         acceptable.  

          fullheader   - Mailx allows a user to default to displaying the 
                         full message header when reading mail or an 
                         abbreviated one.  If this parameter is missing or 
                         is present and set to 'yes' or 'on', the full 
                         header is displayed.  If it is present and set to 
                         'off' or 'no', the shortned header is displayed.  



          EXAMPLE:

               realname = "The OTHER Rick Adams"
               editor = ved
               auto_rot = on
               cc_prompt = on
               organization = "Color Central"
               quote = -
               fullheader = no
