     SUMMARY   

          Post a Usenet news article 

     DESCRIPTION   

          This program assists you in composing a Usenet news article, 
          posts it locally, and also queues it for transmission to your 
          UUCP neighbor the next time uucico is run.  

          The program prompts you for five fields that go in the header of 
          the message, and then allows entry of your article.  Type a "." 
          at the beginning of a line to end your article.  

          If the file ./<homedir>/<user>/UUCP/signature 
          (./<homedir>/<user>/.signature under OSK) exists, its contents of 
          that file will be appended to the article before it is posted.  

          If the file ./<homedir>/<user>/UUCP/organization 
          (./<homedir>/<user>/.organization under OSK) exists, its contents 
          will be used in the "Organization:" line in the header of the 
          article.  If no such file exists, the system-wide organization 
          file in /DD/SYS/UUCP/organization will be used.  If no 
          organization file exists anywhere, the "Organization:" line will 
          be omitted.  

          The five fields you will be prompted for are: 

          Newsgroups: 
              The Usenet newsgroup to which this article should be posted.  
              To be valid, this newsgroup must be listed in the file 
              /DD/SYS/UUCP/ACTIVE.  

          Subject: 
              One-line subject description 







                                                                           




     POSTNEWS                         UUCP                         POSTNEWS


          Keywords: 
              Optional list of keywords for the article; used by some news 
              readers to index articles by keywords.  

          Distribution: 
              Distribution for the article, whether worldwide ("world"), 
              the United States ("usa"), or some more regional 
              distribution.  To be valid, the distribution must be listed 
              in the file /dd/sys/uucp/distributions.  

          Summary: 
              One-line summary of the article's contents.  

          You may choose to save time by putting the name of the newsgroup 
          on the command line, i.e., "postnews ba.test".  Postnews also 
          recognizes "-f <filename>" as an option to include the text of 
          the message from an existing file.  


          EXAMPLE 
          OS9> postnews
          Newsgroups: ba.test
          Subject: This is a test
          Keywords:
          Distribution: ba
          Summary: I am testing my new UUCP software
          Organization: Color Central Software

          This is a test.  This has ONLY been a test.  Had this been an 
          actual posting, you would have been instructed to consult another 
          newsgroup where things more interesting than this rather boring 
          test are even now in progress.  
          .

          COMPOSING NEWS:

          When you are entering news to be sent, there are a number of 
          special commands that can be used to help out, just like when 
          you're sending mail.  

          Initially, you are in OS-9's single line editor.  You can enter 
          and change text as long as you do not hit the ENTER key.  While 
          you are typing an article, there are various commands to assist 
          you in composing the article.  Each of these commands starts with 
          a tilde (~) character at the beginning of the line.  After each 
          command is finished, with the exception of ~a and ~x, you will be 
          returned to OS-9's single line editor.  





                                                                           




     POSTNEWS                         UUCP                         POSTNEWS


          ~v                  Edit article using "vi". "vi" refers to the 
                              Tandy TSEDIT editor after the "vi" patches 
                              have been applied to enable this editor to 
                              work in OS9 device windows.  

          ~e                  Edit article using the editor defined in 
                              either by the environment variable EDITOR or 
                              the file mailrc (.mailrc under OSK) in your 
                              home directory.  The editor named in 'mailrc' 
                              overrides the one defined by EDITOR.  

          ~m[<char>]          Include text of the article being replied 
                              to.  An optional character <char> will be put 
                              at the beginning of each line.  The default 
                              character is ">". This can be changed in 
                              either 'parameters' or 'mailrc' files.  If a 
                              space is used as the character, no quote will 
                              mark the included text.  Examples: 

                                   ~m<SPACE>    This is included article
                                   ~m<ENTER>    >This is included article
                                   ~m-          -This is included article

          ~h                  Display help message.  

          ~x                  Exit POSTNEWS immediately, abandoning 
                              article.  

          ~r[<char>] <file>   Include text from file <file>. If an optional 
                              character <char> follows '~r', each line of 
                              the included text will be started with it.  
                              POSTNEWS assumes <filename> is in your 
                              current data directory unless a full pathname 
                              is given.  Examples: 

                                    ~r <file>   This is included file.
                                    ~r$ <file>  $This is included file.

                              There is no default quote character for this 
                              command.  

                              Before appending the file, the file name is 
                              checked for an ending extention, e.g.  .ar, 
                              .lzh, etc.  If such an extention is found, 
                              POSTNEWS attempts to compared against the 
                              names in the file /DD/SYS/UUCP/bin.list, if 
                              it exists.  This file consists of a list of 
                              names, one to a line, representing names of 
                              binary files.  Common names would be: ar, 
                              gif, pak, lzh, bin, z, vef, and gif.  
                              --NOTE--: The dot (.) is NOT part of the name 
                              in bin.list.)  If a match is found, POSTNEWS 
                              assumes the file is a binary one and 
                              uuencodes it before appending it.  If the 




                                                                           




     POSTNEWS                         UUCP                         POSTNEWS


                              file is uuencoded, the quote char is not 
                              used.  If there is no match or bin.list 
                              doesn't exist, POSTNEWS proceeds as described 
                              above.  

          ~R[<char>] <file>   Works the same as ~r above except no attempt 
                              is made to uuencode the file.  

          ~a                  Abort editing the current article.  You will 
                              be asked if you want to abort.  Only a 'y' or 
                              'Y' will abort the article.  If you were 
                              replying to a article, you will be returned 
                              to that article.  Otherwise POSTNEWS will 
                              exit.  

          ~!                  Forks a shell.  CNTRL-<BREAK) will kill the 
                              shell and you can resume composing the 
                              article.  

          ~u <file>           Uuencode <file> and append it to the 
                              article.  



          When editing an article, DO NOT attempt to do any of the 
          following; the results are unpredictable: 

              o   Change the article header To: or CC: lines.  The changes 
                  will not be used when the mail is sent.  You can change 
                  the Subject: line, however.  

              o   Remove the blank line following the article header.  
                  Mailers on remote systems expect this blank line to be 
                  there and start with an End-Of-Line character 

          When you are finished composing the article, you send it by 
          entering a period (.) followed by <ENTER>. The period must be the 
          first and only character on the line.
