     SUMMARY:   

          Convert Rick's Adams spool mail format v4.2 and earlier to new 
          format used by UUCPbb package.  

     DESCRIPTION:   

          Rick Adams' original mail format keeps all the mail in one 
          directory.  Each user's mailbox is a separate file in this mail 
          directory.  The disadvantage with this format is it slow on the 
          CoCo. If the mail file grew too large, there was the danger of 
          file segment error.  Deleting and saving mail was slow as well.  

          The new mail format keeps the original mail directory.  However, 
          the mailbox file is replaced with a mailbox directory for each 
          user.  Each message is stored as an individual file.  The file's 
          name is 'mYYYYMMDDHHMMSS' where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is the year, 
          month, day, hour, minute and second that RMAIL processed the 
          message.  Using this format it is much easier to manipulate each 
          message.  

          There is another file in each user's mailbox directory called 
          'mail..list'.  This file keeps an ordered list of the mailbox 
          contents.  mail..list is used by MAIL to keep track of 
          information about each message.  RMAIL updates this file as mail 
          is processed.  MAIL also updates this file when mail is deleted 
          or if it detects an error in the file.  

          CNVRTMAIL makes it easier to convert from Rick's old format to 
          the new one.  If you have never previous run Rick's original UUCP 
          program, there is no reason to use CNVRTMAIL. CNVRTMAIL assumes 
          the current mailbox is in the old format.  

          When first run, CNVRTMAIL asks to verify which users in the 
          password file are valid mail users on the system.  This prevents 
          creating mailboxes for remote UUCP systems as well as valid 
          users.  After verifying users, CNVRTMAIL goes through each user 
          creating a mailbox directory and splitting each message into 
          individual files with unique consective timestamps.  The 
          mail..list file is then created.  








                                                                           




     CNVRTMAIL                        UUCP                        CNVRTMAIL


          CNVRTMAIL defaults to saving the user's original mail in the root 
          directory of /DD in the file named '<username>.oldmail' as a 
          "just in case".  Once proper operation of the new mail is 
          verified, the old mail files can be deleted.  If the commmand 
          line option -k is used, the old mail file is deleted after the 
          new mailbox is created.  


     BUGS   

          CNVRTMAIL is not terribly smart.  It does occasionally get 
          confused when changing from the old to the new format.  CNVRTMAIL 
          looks for a line starting with either the string ">From " or 
          "From " to signal the start of a message.  If a sentence in the 
          message body starts with either string, CNVRTMAIL thinks it is a 
          new message.  

          The easiest way to spot and fix this error is to change mailbox 
          directory defined in the /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters file.  The 
          parameter 'maildir' points to the mailbox directory.  Look in 
          each user's mailbox directory at the file 'mail..list' when 
          CNVRTMAIL is finished.  These two lines from a mail..list file 
          will illustrate the procedure:

     |      |         | |  |______ number of lines
     |      |         | |_________ Subject:
     |      |         |___________ From:
     |      |_____________________ file name
     |____________________________ message status

               Line #2 above is missing both the From: and Subject: 
               fields.  While the Subject: field may occasionally be empty, 
               the From: never should be.  If you list file 
               'm19930613000924 you will probably find the line reads, for 
               example: 

               >From the dawn of time, this mail was waiting...

               This "message" actually belongs to the file in the line 
               above, i.e.  m19930613000917.  With a text editor combine 
               the second message with the first, be sure to removed the 
               '>' from '>From'. Save the restored message out and delete 
               the incorrect message file.  

               You could edit the incorrect line mail..list.  This not 
               necessary, however.  As long as you delete the incorrect 
               message, MAILX will reconstruct mail..list the next time the 
               user's mail is read.  






                                                                           




     CNVRTMAIL                        UUCP                        CNVRTMAIL


               --IMPORTANT--: Be sure you set the owner ID of any changed 
               files to the owner ID of the mailbox.  If you do not do 
               this, the mail cannot be read by its owner!  You can use the 
               CHOWN utility, which is included in the UUCPbb package, to 
               do this.
