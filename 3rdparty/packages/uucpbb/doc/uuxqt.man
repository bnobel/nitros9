     CALLING SEQUENCE: 

       uuxqt [opts]  <sys> [<sys>...]  [opts]
       
              <sys>  - process work for <sys>.  If <sys> name is 'ALL', all
                         systems in the Systems file are processed
       
         opts:  -xN  - set debug level to N.  0 (default) = OFF, 9 = highest
                -q   - work quietly (no messages to the screen)

     DESCRIPTION:   

          UUXQT is a utility which processes incoming mail received via 
          UUCICO.  Mail received normally consists of a data file and an 
          associated work or execution file.  UUXQT is usually forked by 
          UUCICO. On occasions, you may have to run UUXQT manually such as 
          when you run UUCICO with the -u option.  

          UUXQT scans the spool directory for the given system for work or 
          execution files and proceeds as those files dictate.  The work 
          may take the form of incoming mail to be distributed via RMAIL, 
          and/or incoming Usenet news articles to be distributed via RNEWS. 
          If UUXQT cannot decide to do with a file, it does nothing.  UUXQT 
          logs all work done to the file /DD/LOG/uulog.  

          UUXQT will process mail for each system given on the command 
          line.  Invalid system names are flagged with an error message.  
          If the system name 'ALL' (upper case only) is specified, UUXQT 
          will search the spool directory of each system listed in the 
          Systems file for mail waiting to be processed.  

          When UUXQT starts, it checks to see if there is another UUXQT is 
          already running.  If one s, a signal is sent to that UUXQT 
          informing it of newly arrived work.  The second UUXQT then 
          exits.  The first UUXQT intercepts the signal and processes the 
          newly arrived work after it finishes the batch it is working on.  

          <debug> is the level of diagnostics desire from 0 (off) to 9 
          (highest).  The default is 0 is assumed if no debug level is 
          specified.  All debug output is logged to the file 
          /DD/LOG/uulog.  

          If the -q option is used, UUXQT will not send any message to the 
          screen.  Information will still go to the log file.
