     CALLING SEQUENCE 

          uucp <file_to_send> <path_to_send_file_to>
          uucp <file_to_get> <remote_path_of_file_to_get>

     SUMMARY   

          Queue up a file transfer request.  

     DESCRIPTION   

          The uucp command can be used to initiate file transfers to and 
          from the remote system.  The remote system usually won't let you 
          put a file just anywhere...  usually there is a 
          /usr/spool/uucppublic directory to which anyone is allowed to 
          write files, though.  So to transfer your startup file to your 
          immediate UUCP neighbor "sandstorm", for example: 

              uucp /dd/startup "sandstorm!/usr/spool/uucppublic/startup" 

          and to read it back: 

              uucp "sandstorm!/usr/spool/uucppublic/startup" /dd/startup2 

          This would just queue up a job to do the transfer; uucico would 
          do the actual work.  This means that people who know what they're 
          doing can send you files (and read your files) remotely, so you 
          might want to be security conscious and NOT run uucico from your 
          root account (user 0).  Also, make sure the permissions on your 
          files are set such that whatever account you run uucico under can 
          ONLY do things on your system that you feel like permitting.  

          The directory /DD/USR/SPOOL/UUCPPUBLIC is your equivalent of the 
          standard UNIX /usr/spool/uucppublic directory.  If someone wants 
          to transfer a file to you, you can tell them that would be a good 
          directory to put it into.  Make sure anyone can write in that 
          directory, so that anyone wanting to transfer a file to your 
          system will be sure to have a place to put it.  

          If you know enough about the way the network's connected, and the 
          various machines involved are configured in a way that allows it, 
          you can transfer files between machines that aren't immediate 
          neighbors, like this: 

          uucp /dd/file "sandstorm!gigsys!tatooine!/usr/spool/uucppublic/file"

          The above command would cause the file "file" to be transferred 
          from your hard disk to the /usr/spool/uucppublic directory on 
          system "tatooine", travelling there by ways of intermediate 
          systems "sandstorm" and "gigsys".
