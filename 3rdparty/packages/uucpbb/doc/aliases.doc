          /DD/<homedir>/<user>/UUCP/aliases      (CoCo)

     SUMMARY:   

          This file contains a list of commonly-used mail addresses.

     DESCRIPTION:   


          Each user may put an "aliases" file in their home directory.  On 
          the CoCo the file goes in the UUCP directory in the user's home 
          directory.  Under OSK the alias file goes in the user's root home 
          directory and is called .aliases (note the initial period 
          character).  The alias file is used to keep track of 
          commonly-used mail addresses.  Each alias is entered in the file 
          one to a line.  The format for an entry is: 

               alias [name_string] uucp_address 

          The name_string field is optional.  The simplest alias entry is a 
          simple name for the alias such as "fred", "barney", "joe" etc.  
          This is followed by one or more spaces and then the UUCP mail 
          address of that person, such as: gigsys!evil!purple!barney.  

          The second form is a simple name followed by one or more spaces 
          with a string followed by one or more spaces and the UUCP mail 
          address.  name_string can be put in double quotes, but this not 
          necessary.  The name_string field is for compatibility with Jeff 
          Shepler's mailer, Palm. Both Mailx and Palm share the same 
          aliases file.  This version of Mailx ignores the name_string 
          field.  Only the leftmost and rightmost fields are used.  The 
          uucp_address field may either be a bang path or domain style 
          address.  Lines starting with either a '#', '*', or a carriage 
          return, are considered comment lines and ignored.  

          Each user maintains their own "aliases" file, at their 
          discretion.  They may then use the alias name rather than the 
          full UUCP mail address when sending mail.  The mail program will 
          automatically look up the given address in the user's alias file, 
          looking for substitutions to be made.  The full UUCP address is 
          used in the mail header.  Once a match is found, no further 
          searches are made.  Thus, if you have two entries: 

               bob  postmaster
               [lots more entries]
               bob  wa2egp@delphi.com

          The mail will end up going to 'postmaster' even though you 
          thought it would go to 'wa2egp@delphi.com
