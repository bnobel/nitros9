     SUMMARY:   

          Subscribe or unsubscribe to Usenet newsgroups.  

     DESCRIPTION:   


          These commands allow individuals to select the newsgroups they 
          are able to read with READNEWS. The complete list of newsgroups 
          the system receives is in the file /DD/SYS/UUCP/active.  

          SUBSCRIBE allows the user to subscribe to one or more of the 
          newsgroups the system receives.  If the newsgroup name is 'all', 
          the user is subscribed to all the newsgroups listed in the active 
          file.  The file 'newsrc' (.newsrc under OSK) in the user's home 
          directory is updated to reflect the changes.  

          UNSUBSCRIBE allows the user to unsubscribe from one or more of 
          the newsgroups the system receives.  If the newsgroup name is 
          'all', the user is unsubscribed from all the newsgroups listed in 
          the active file.  The file 'newsrc' (.newsrc under OSK) in the 
          user's home directory is updated to reflect the changes.  

          Neither SUBSCRIBE nor UNSUBSCRIBE affect the newsfeed the system 
          gets.  For example, if the newsfeed does not normally include the 
          rec.foods.sourdough newgroups using SUBSCRIBE is meaningless.  
          Similarly, UNSUBSCRIBE does not remove that newsgroup from the 
          systems newsfeed.  To make such changes, the system administrator 
          must contact his/her feed's system admininstrator.
