     PROGRAM:   

          rmail

     CALLING SEQUENCE: 

          rmail [<filename>] <uucp_address>

     SUMMARY:   

          Distribute mail message to local or remote users.

     DESCRIPTION:   

          RMAIL takes an email message and distributes it to the proper 
          user based on the given uucp_address.  If the uucp_address is for 
          a user on another system, RMAIL queues the mail to be sent 
          remotely the next time UUCICO is run.  This program is usually 
          run via MAIL, UUXQT or UUCICO. It is not normally executed 
          directly by the user.  

          If filename is specified, the email message is taken from that 
          file.  If no filename is given, the message is read from standard 
          input.  

          RMAIL recognizes three special local pseudo-users.  One is user 
          'nobody'.  This is name of RMAIL's bit bucket.  Any mail 
          addressed to 'nobody' goes in the bit bucket.  

          A second special user is 'fileserv'. Mail sent to this "user" 
          tells RMAIL to fork the fileserver program FILESERV. The message 
          is sent to FILESERV for processing.  (see FILESERV.MAN).  

          A third special user is 'mail-server'. Mail sent to this "user" 
          tells RMAIL to fork the program MAILSERVER. The message is piped 
          to MAILSERVER for processing.  MAILSERVER has not been written.  
          The intention is to allow users to write applications program to 
          interface with UUCPbb. The application only has to read its 
          standard input to get the passed message.  How the message is 
          interpreted is up to the application.  The next update of RMAIL 
          will allow many different type of psuedo-users which will be able 
          to fork more than simply FILESERV or MAILSERVER.  

          If the mail is to a valid local user, RMAIL puts the message in 
          the user's mailbox.  The message is given the file name 
          'mYYYYMMDDHHMMSS', where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS is the year, month, date, 
          hour, minute and second timestamp when RMAIL processed the mail.  
          RMAIL also updates the 'mail..list' file in the user's mailbox 
          directory.  The top mailbox directory where all the user's mail 
          is kept is specified by the parameter 'maildir' in 
          /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters.  







                                                                           




     RMAIL                                                            RMAIL


          If the message is to a non-existent local user, the message is 
          sent to the user specified in the Parameters file as 'errorsto'.  

          On a UUCP system, the standard user, who should get bounced mail, 
          other errors is 'postmaster'. 'postmaster' is also the user mail 
          is sent to when a remote system doesn't know any other users on 
          your system and wish to make inquiries.  It is STRONGLY suggested 
          a separate 'postmaster' account be created for this purpose.  
          Attempting to get around this by using an alias to point to 
          another account will likely lead to strange and unpredicatable 
          results.  


     BUGS   

          RMAIL isn't very sociable about returning undeliverable mail.  
          Currently, it sends all such mail to the 'errorsto' user.  For 
          now, this user will have to manually return the mail.  RMAIL 
          really should return the mail to the original sender itself.  
          Obviously, RMAIL needs better manners.  

          On the CoCo, there is a limit to the number of messages that can 
          be waiting.  If termcap support is not compiled in, there can be 
          about 185 messages waiting.  With termcap support, this number 
          will drop, probably to around 125-140. (This has not been test 
          thoroughly.)
