     SUMMARY:   

          These files contain a few lines which can be added to the end of 
          outgoing mail or news articles.  

     DESCRIPTION:   


          Each user can create a signature files in their home directory.  
          MAILX and POSTNEWS will attempt to read the contents and append 
          it to the outgoing message.  alt_signature (.alt_signature under 
          OSK) is an alternative signature file file which is available 
          with the -n option in MAILX.  

          The contents of signature is high individual.  There are a few 
          guidelines to consider: 

          Signatures should be short.  Generally, four lines or so is 
          sufficient.  The signature generally contains your name and email 
          address(es) in case the message arrives with the From: field 
          mangled.  Some folks put short quotes in their signature files as 
          well.  Excessively long signatures are annoying.  It can be 
          annoying to read a two or three line message followed by a ten 
          line signature.  After reading a number of similar messages, it 
          can get really annoying.  
          
          Each in the signature file should be less than 80 characters.  
          Each line should end with carriage.  You cannot assume the other 
          person's terminal will correctly wrap-around lines which are too 
          long.  
          
          Do not use graphics or control characters in the signature for 
          (or mail text for that matter).  The graphics and control 
          characters may do nice fancy things on YOUR terminal; however, 
          the things they do on or to a remote reader's terminal may not be 
          so nice.  You could easily make your message unreadable for the 
          receiver.
