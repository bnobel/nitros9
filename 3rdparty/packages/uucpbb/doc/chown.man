     SUMMARY   

          Change ownership of a file or directory to that of another user 

     DESCRIPTION   

          CHOWN allows a user to change the ownership of a file and/or 
          directory belonging to them to that of another user.  The user 
          cannot change the ownership of a file or directory if it does not 
          belong to them.  The only exception to this is the superuser.  
          He/she can change the ownership of anyone's file or directory to 
          that of anyone else 

          Either the user's name or the decimal value of the user's ID as 
          listed in the password file maybe be given.  File and directory 
          names may be mixed on the command line.
