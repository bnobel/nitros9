     SUMMARY   

          Fix a text file so it has OS-9 tabbing and end of line 
          terminators.  

     DESCRIPTION   

          FIXTEXT is a filter which expands tab characters, removes ESCAPE 
          sequences and changes linefeeds to carriage returns.  It is 
          useful on files received from UNIX systems where the end of line 
          character is a linefeed rather than OS-9 carriage return.  OS-9 
          on the CoCo can't deal tab characters or escape sequences so 
          these need to be filtered.  

          Examples of using FIXTEXT: 

               fixtext <foo >bar 

          FIXTEXT reads the standard input which is redirected from the 
          file 'foo'.  It writes the changed file to the standard output 
          which is redirected to the file bar.  

               fixtext foo !  mailx him@his.system.org -dps "your file" 

          FIXTEXT gets its input from the file 'foo' and pipes the output 
          to Mailx for mailing to someone.  

               list bar !  fixtext - foo 

          The '-' in command line tells FIXTEXT to read in the standard 
          input.  It reads the output of LIST which is piped to FIXTEXT. 
          The output of FIXTEXT is put in the the file 'foo'. If 'foo' 
          already exists, it will be silently overwritten.  

               fixtext foobar barfoo 

          FIXTEXT gets it input from the file 'foobar' and writes it output 
          to the file 'barfoo'. If 'barfoo' already exists, it will be 
          silently overwritten.
