     FILE   

          /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters

     SUMMARY:   

          This file contains the global system settings for all UUCP 
          executables.  

     DESCRIPTION:   

          Each entry in this file is on a separate line and follows the 
          syntax.  --NOTE--: There must be at least one space on each side 
          of the '=': 

          parameter = value

          The case (upper or lower) of the parameter is ignored.  Empty 
          lines and lines beginning with '*' or '#' are ignored as comment 
          lines.  There is no particular order the parameters must be in, 
          i.e.  'auto_rot' can be before or after 'quote' 

          --NOTE-- If the same parameter is given more than once in the 
          Parameters file, only the value of the last entry will be used.  

          If a parameter is missing, it assumes a default value unless 
          otherwise noted.  The parameters are: 

          auto_rot     - Specify on (or yes), or off (or no).  The default 
                         value is OFF (no). If on (yes) is set, news 
                         articles with the keyword rot13 will be 
                         automatically rot13'd when read.  Default is OFF.  

          cc_prompt    - Specify on (or yes), or off (or no).  The default 
                         is off (no). If on (yes) is set, the user will be 
                         prompted "Cc: " to send a carbon copy of each mail 
                         message they send.  Default is OFF 

          quote        - This is the default quote character which will 
                         start each line when the tilde command "~m" is 
                         used in MAIL and POSTNEWS. It will be overriden by 
                         users' settings in their mailrc files.  Default is 
                         '>' 

          organization - When sending news articles, this line specifies 
                         the Organization: field in the article header.  If 
                         the name of the organization is longer than one 
                         word, it must be enclosed in double quotes.  An 
                         organization specified in this file overrides 
                         users' settings in their mailrc files.  There is 
                         no default.  







                                                                           




     Parmeters                        UUCP                       Parameters


          tz           - This parameter takes one or two values.  The first 
                         value is the name of your time zone; the second is 
                         the name of your timezone during daylight savings 
                         time.  Use only one value if you never change to 
                         daylight savings time.  While you can use can use 
                         time zone names such as EST EDT (Eastern Standard 
                         Time and Eastern Daylight Time, respectively), the 
                         suggested names specify your time's offset (in 
                         military time format) from Universal Time (or 
                         Greenwich Mean Time).  For example, EST is -0500 
                         and EDT is -0400. This means that Eastern Standard 
                         Time is five hours and zero minutes earlier than 
                         GMT. The American standard for daylight standard 
                         time is assumed -- from 2 a.m.  of the first 
                         Sunday in April to 2 a.m.  of the last Sunday in 
                         October.  There is no default.  

          bigscratch   - This parameter specifies a full path to the 
                         directory where temporary files will be created 
                         when receiving compressed batched news.  The 
                         device containing this directory should have 
                         enough free space to comfortably hold large files, 
                         e.g.  two files nearly 64K long.  These files may 
                         be larger depending on how many newsgroups you 
                         receive.  RNEWS will first try to use the RAM disk 
                         for individual articles if it is big enough rather 
                         than 'bigscratch'. This greatly speeds up 
                         processing.  The size of the RAM is set by the 
                         #define RAMDSIZE in uucp.h.  The current value is 
                         80000 (80K). You can force the RAM disk to never 
                         be used by setting the size to O. Be sure the 
                         ending 'L' is on any changed value.  RNEWS assumes 
                         this space is free when news is processed.  If it 
                         isn't, you will probably lose articles!  If the 
                         RAM disk is not big enough or not accessible 
                         bigscratch will be used.  See 'scratchdir' below 
                         for additional information.  The default value is 
                         /DD. This directory can but does not have to be 
                         either the same device or directory as 'scratch'. 
                         Default is /DD.  

          scratch      - This parameter specifies a full path to the 
                         directory where temporary files will be created 
                         when receiving or sending mail messages.  The 
                         device containing this directory should have 
                         enough free space to comfortably hold large 
                         files.  If you have a RAM drive which is large 
                         enough and that drive will always be iniz'd (and 
                         formatted if necessary) when running UUCP 
                         executables, then that is the recommended choice 
                         on the CoCo. The default value is /DD; you may 
                         wish to change this to /DD/TEMP or some other 
                         device.  Many programs will run noticably faster 
                         if the device containing the scratch directory is 




                                                                           




     Parmeters                        UUCP                       Parameters


                         different from /DD. Default is /DD.  

          errorsto     - This is the name of the user on the system where 
                         undeliverable mail should be sent.  The default is 
                         'postmaster'.  

          pager        - This parameter specifies an optional file viewer 
                         such as MORE or VU which will be used by Mailx or 
                         READNEWS when reading mail or news.  If this 
                         parameter is not specified, mail and news will be 
                         displayed in scrolling form.  There is no 
                         default.  

          nodename     - This is the *unique* UUCP name of this system.  
                         The name may consist of one to eight (but not more 
                         than eight) alphanumeric characters.  Punctuation 
                         is not allowed as part of the name.  There is no 
                         default.  Examples: 

                              ccentral
                              mytoy
                              kc2wz

          sitename     - This is the domain name of this site.  If your 
                         system has a fully qualified domain name, it goes 
                         here.  If it does not, the entry should be your 
                         nodename with '.UUCP' added to it.  There is no 
                         default.  Examples: 

                              kc2wz.bubble.org
                              ccentral.UUCP

          uucphost     - This is a bang-path to the nearest UUCP smart mail 
                         host.  This will usually (but not always) be your 
                         UUCP neighbor.  Any mail sent via a UUCP bang-path 
                         which isn't explicitly sent to one of your UUCP 
                         neighbors will be sent via this path to the 
                         destination.  This parameter and the two following 
                         are further explained below.  There is no 
                         default.  

          inhost       - This is a bang-path to the nearest Internet smart 
                         mail host.  Mail which is sent to an 
                         internet-style address such as user@site.domain 
                         will be forwarded to this host.  Most UUCP smart 
                         mailers also understand the Internet address 
                         format.  There is no default.  

          bithost      - This is a bang-path to the nearest BITNet host.  
                         If this is left blank, mail will be routed to the 
                         Internet smart mail host after ".bitnet" has been 
                         appended to the address.  Mail is assumed to be 






                                                                           




     Parmeters                        UUCP                       Parameters


                         destined for the BITNet when it is of the form: 
                         user@site where site does not contain any periods 
                         (.). There is no default.  

          newshost     - This is name of your default USENET newsfeed 
                         host.  This is merely the name of the system NOT 
                         the path to it.  If this parameter is not 
                         specified, your default news host will be the 
                         first system found in the /DD/SYS/UUCP/Systems 
                         file.  There is no default.  

          window       - This parameter specifies the UUCP g protocol 
                         window size for UUCICO. Possible values are from 1 
                         to 7. 1 (the default) is suggested unless you are 
                         using SACIA or DACIA (in which case you can use a 
                         higher value, 2-7, depending on how large you have 
                         set the ACIA driver's buffer), or have patched 
                         Aciapak to have a larger receive buffer (in which 
                         case you can use 2 or 3). The throughput, 
                         generally, will not increase with a window size 
                         greater than 3 on the CoCo. Default is 1.  

          hangup       - This parameter tells how to hang up your modem.  
                         There are two choices "DTR" (drop the DTR line) or 
                         "ATH", (send +++ATH). Default is ATH.  

          spooldir     - This is the full path to directory where UUCICO 
                         looks for queued mail/files to transfer to each 
                         remote.  Each remote you call has its own 
                         directory within spooldir.  The suggested 
                         directory is /DD/USR/SPOOL/UUCP.  There is no 
                         default.  

          maildir      - This is the full path to directory containing the 
                         users' mailbox directories.  This parameter is 
                         only used if the environment variable MAIL is not 
                         set.  

          newsdir      - This is the full path to directory where Usenet 
                         news articles are put.  READNEWS and POSTNEWS look 
                         here for news.  The suggested directory is 
                         /DD/USR/SPOOL/NEWS. There is no default 

          pubdir       - This is the full path to the directory where 
                         incoming public files (not mail or news) are put.  
                         The are files which are transferred by the UUCP 
                         program itself.  The suggested directory is 
                         /DD/USR/SPOOL/UUCPPUBLIC. There is no default.  

          server       - This parameter specifies whether the OS-9 
                         fileserver is active.  Specify on or off, yes or 
                         no.  If the fileserver is active, any mail sent to 
                         the user 'fileserv' on this system gets passed 
                         along to the program FILESERV. If the fileserver 




                                                                           




     Parmeters                        UUCP                       Parameters


                         is not active, any mail sent to the local user 
                         'fileserv' gets a "not available" response.  
                         Default is OFF.  

          fileserver   - This parameter specifies the full path to the 
                         directory where files available through the 
                         fileserver are kept.  The suggested directory is 
                         /DD/USR/SPOOL/FILES. If this parameter is 
                         unspecified, the directory doesn't exist or is 
                         unreadable, the fileserver is not active; any mail 
                         to user 'fileserv' gets a "not available" 
                         response.  There is no default.  

          incoming     - This parameter gives the directory where files 
                         sent to the fileserver are placed for the system 
                         administrator to review.  If this parameter is set 
                         to 'no', 'off', missing or the fileserver itself 
                         is not active, the fileserver will reject attempts 
                         to submit files.  This feature is not implement 
                         yet.  All attempts to submit a file are currently 
                         rejected.  


          The parameters 'auto_rot', 'cc_prompt', and 'organization' are 
          also settable in each user's mailrc (.mailrc under OSK) file.  
          This file is kept in the user's home directory.  The mailrc 
          values will override the system-wide settings, except for 
          'organization'. The /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters file 'organization', 
          if defined, overrides the user's mailrc definition.  Attempts by 
          users to redefine any other parameters is ignored.

          Assume that you are on coco3, gigsys is on the Internet as 
          gigsys.com, and sandstorm runs a smart UUCP mailer and you get 
          your news from sandstorm.  In this example, you would use define: 

               uucphost = sandstorm
               
               inhost = sandstorm!gigsys
               
               bithost = 
               
               newshost = sandstorm




































                                                                           




     Parmeters                        UUCP                       Parameters


          If, instead, sandstorm and hostbase both ran non-smart-mailers 
          (mailers which don't use pathalias and are not Internet mailers), 
          but garage3 ran a smart UUCP mailer, you would change the above 
          uucphost line to: 

               uucphost = sandstorm!garage3 

          Or if homebase provided your Usenet news feed only, you would 
          change the above newshost line to: 

               newshost = homebase 

          Remember, you should get permission to route mail through each 
          machine you explicitly route all of your mail through!  This 
          includes each machine you specify in any of the three uucphost, 
          inhost, or bithost.  Generally, your mail UUCP connection will 
          work as both uucp and Internet host, and you will leave bithost 
          blank.

               # name of this UUCP site
               nodename = ccentral

               sitename = ccentral.UUCP
