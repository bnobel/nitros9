     SUMMARY:   

          Process commands sent to OS-9 fileserver by email.

     DESCRIPTION:   

          FileServ is an simple OS-9 fileserver program for use with the 
          UUCPbb package.  FileServ is never run directly by a user.  It is 
          forked by RMAIL when mail is sent to a special local "user": 
          fileserv (note the spelling).  

          The fileserver is turned on by setting two parameters in the 
          /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters file: 'server' and 'fileserver'. If 
          'server' is set to 'off', 'no' or the parameter is missing, the 
          server is inactive.  If the parameter 'fileserver' is missing or 
          the directory it points to is not readable by user 0 (superuser), 
          the fileserver is also inactive.  If the fileserver is inactive, 
          mail sent to 'fileserv' will get a "File server not available" 
          response.  

          FileServ reads its standard input for the message contents.  The 
          sender's return address is extracted from the header.  The 
          Subject: line is ignored in this version.  FileServ then reads 
          the message body looking for commands, one to a line, which it 
          understands.  Unrecognized commands are ignored.  There are five 
          commands which FileServ understands at present: 

          reply <address> - Tells the fileserver to send its responses to 
                            the address <address> instead the one appearing 
                            in the message header.  This command MUST be 
                            the first one given in the message body.  If it 
                            is not, it is ignored and the address from the 
                            sender's header will be used.  

          help            - Sends a help file.  The name of this file is 
                            /DD/SYS/UUCP/FileServ.help. It gives brief 
                            description of how to use the fileserver.  You 
                            may customize for your particular system.  The 
                            commands and their description should not be 
                            changed, however.  

          dir [pathname]  - Gets the contents of the directory where the 
                            publicly retrivable files are kept.  This 
                            directory is specified in the 
                            /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters by the parameter 
                            'fileserver'. If an optional pathname is 




                                                                           




     FILESERV                         UUCP                         FILESERV


                            included, FileServ assumes [pathname] is a 
                            subdirectory within the directory specified by 
                            the 'fileserver' parameter.  Attempts to get 
                            illegal directories will be rejected, e.g.  
                            /DD/SYS 

          get <filename>  - Tells FileServ to look for <filename> in the 
                            allowed files directory and send it to the 
                            requester.  If the file has an extension 
                            matching one in the file /DD/SYS/UUCP/bin.list, 
                            the file will be uuencoded before sending.  
                            <filename> can be a full pathname.  Full 
                            pathnames are forced to be subdirectories of 
                            the 'fileserver' directory.  For example, if 
                            the allowed files directory is 
                            /H1/USR/SPOOL/FILES and the command 'get 
                            /dd/sys/password' is received, the pathname 
                            /H1/USR/SPOOL/FILES/dd/sys/password will be 
                            used.  

          quit            - Tells FileServ not to process any further lines 
                            in the message body.  Any commands after 'quit' 
                            are ignored.  

          submit <file>   - Tells FileServ that the lines following this 
                            command are a file submission to the 
                            fileserver.  These files are placed in the 
                            directory defined by the 'incoming' parameter.  
                            If the file is uuencoded, it will be uudecoded 
                            afterwards.  The file remains in the incoming 
                            directory until the system administrator 
                            reviews it.  The system administrator is sent 
                            mail informing him/her of the file arrival.  If 
                            the 'incoming' parameter is missing, set to 
                            'no' or 'off', the file submission tossed in 
                            the bit bucket.  The sender is sent a message 
                            informing them that file submissions are not 
                            being accepted.  

                            This feature is not yet fully implemented.  
                            FileServ currently ignores file submissions, 
                            though it does inform the system adminstrator 
                            of the attempt.  It also informs the sender 
                            submissions are not currently accepted.  



          FileServ has security feature which will not allow pathnames with 
          '../' or '@' characters.  This prevents someone from trying to 
          "sneak" around by backing up one or more levels.  Not allowing 
          '@' prevents someone from opening the disk as a raw device, i.e.  
          /h0@. Any pathname starting with a '/' is assumed to be a 
          subdirectory within the allowed files directory.  All other names 
          are assume to be in the root of the allowed files directory 




                                                                           




     FILESERV                         UUCP                         FILESERV


          If FileServ gets a questionable file transfer request or it 
          simply can't find the file or directory, it sends the requester a 
          "can't find <file/directory>" message.  It also sends a warning 
          message to the 'errorsto' user defined in 
          /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters.  

          All current FileServ activities are kept in the /DD/LOG directory 
          under the name 'fileserv'. UUCLEAN rotates the fileserver's log 
          files every time it is run.  It is a good practice to have CRON, 
          MCRON or some other task scheduler run UUCLEAN once a day so 
          these log files don't grow excessively large.  

     BUGS   

          When uuencoding files, FileServ doesn't check for file size.  If 
          the requested file is 300K, FileServ will cheerfully uuencode and 
          send it.  Many UUCP sites will not accept mail larger than 100K. 
          If a uuencoded file is greater than 100K, it will most likely 
          bounce.  For now, FileServ should not be used with large files.  
          This problem will be fixed in a future update.

     The original FileServ program was written by Rick Adams. Rick 
     contributed it to be included in the UUCPbb package.  (Thanks Rick!!!) 
     Improvements were made by Bob Billson <bob@kc2wz.bubble.org> for use 
     with UUCPbb.
