     SUMMARY   

          Allow a user to log on to the system.  

     DESCRIPTION   

          LOGIN is a program to allow users to log on to OS-9/6809 systems 
          such as the CoCo. Normally, LOGIN is forked by a program such as 
          TSMON. This version of LOGIN is not required in order to run UUCP 
          on the CoCo.  

          When LOGIN runs, it sends the user its login prompt, 'login: '.  
          The user responds by entering their username and a carriage 
          return.  LOGIN checks the password file to see if username is 
          valid.  If it isn't LOGIN, repeats the 'login: ' prompt.  The 
          user only gets 3 chances to get it right.  After the third 
          mistake, LOGIN exits.  

          If the username matches an entry in the password file, LOGIN 
          checks to see if a password is required.  If one is, LOGIN sends 
          its 'Password: ' prompt.  For security, the user's password is 
          not echoed back to them.  If the user makes a mistake entering 
          the password, LOGIN will make them start again at the 'login: ' 
          prompt.  

          The user has 10 seconds to finish typing their response and hit 
          <ENTER> at either of the two prompts.  Each time the user sends a 
          character, the timer is reset.  If LOGIN times out, it logs the 
          error to the /DD/LOG/login.errors file and exits.  

          If the username and password match, LOGIN checks the 
          /DD/LOG/login.aliases file to see if there this is an alias for 
          another username.  If the file does not exist, LOGIN continues 
          on.  If the file exists, LOGIN expects it to contain one or more 
          entries, one to a line, with the format: 

               alias newlogname 

          If the username matches the 'alias' name, LOGIN logs the user in 
          under the corresponding 'newlogname' during this session.  If no 
          match is found, LOGIN uses the original username.  Any lines 
          beginning with a '#', <SPACE>, <TAB> or carriage return character 
          are considered comment lines and ignored.  







                                                                           




     LOGIN                            UUCP                            LOGIN


          Next, LOGIN checks for the existence of the file 
          /DD/LOG/login.times. If it does not exist, LOGIN continues on.  
          If the file exists, LOGIN expects it to contain one or more 
          entries, one to a line, with the format: 

               login_name start_time end_time 

          start_time and end_time are in 24-hour time format.  For example, 
          0930 is 9:30 a.m., 2015 is 8:20 p.m.  

          LOGIN tries to match the username with a corresponding login_name 
          entry.  If one is found, LOGIN checks to see if the user is 
          within the range of allowed times.  If not, LOGIN tells the user, 
          logs the error and exits.  If the time is acceptable, the user is 
          allowed to continue.  

          Alternatively, if the end_time field is missing and the 
          start_time field contains the word "never", the attempt to log in 
          is always rejected.  

          If there is no entry for that particular username, LOGIN assumes 
          the user is allowed in at any time.  

          If LOGIN gets this far successfully, it chains to the command(s) 
          given as the last field in the user's password file entry.  

     NOTES   

          This version of LOGIN is only for use with OS-9/6809 systems.  It 
          is not currently supported for OS-9/68K.
