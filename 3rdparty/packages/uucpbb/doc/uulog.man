     SUMMARY   

          Print summary of UUCP and UUXQT traffic from the daily 
          /DD/LOG/uulog files.  Or print summary of /DD/LOG/fileserv log 
          files.  

     DESCRIPTION   

          UULOG provides a way to view the daily log files created by 
          UUCIO, UUXQT and FileServ.  The UUCP log files are recorded in 
          the file /DD/LOG/uulog. The log files kept by FileServ are 
          recorded in /DD/LOG/filserv.  The options available are: 

                 -s <system>  Display log information of work related to 
                              <system>.  

                 -u <user>    Display log information of worked related to 
                              <user>.  

                 -d <days>    Display the log file <days> old.  Log files 
                              are kept for the previous 7 days.  See 
                              UUCLEAN.MAN.  

                 -f           Display the log files for the fileserver 
                              rather than the UUCP log files.  Only -d is 
                              meaningful with this option.  

          EXAMPLES: 

               uulog

               uulog -s anduin -d2 

          Lists all information in /DD/LOG/uulog involving calls to or from 
          anduin from the log file of two days ago (/DD/LOG/uulog.2).  






                                                                           




     UULOG                                                            UULOG


               uulog -u uuxqt 

          List all transactions for the current day done by the "user" 
          (program in this example) UUXQT.  

               uulog -f 

          List the fileserver's log, /DD/LOG/fileserv, for the current 
          day.  

               uulog -fd4 

          Lists all information involving the fileserver's file transfers 
          from the log file of four days ago (/DD/LOG/fileserv.4) 



          UULOG was originally written by Mark Griffith to work with his 
          OS-9 UUCP suite.  Thanks to Mark for his okey-dokey to modify it 
          to work with the UUCPbb package.
