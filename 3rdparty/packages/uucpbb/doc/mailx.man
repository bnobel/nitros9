          On the CoCo only using Shell+, non-superusers need to use '*'
          instead of '@' in command line addresses.

     SUMMARY:  

          Send and receive electronic mail

     DESCRIPTION:   

                                  SENDING MAIL

          Mail may be sent one of two ways, either entering it directly on 
          the keyboard, or the input can be redirected from a file.  The 
          recipient may be on this this system, on one or more remote UUCP 
          nodes, or both.  The commands will be discussed in general first 
          and in more detail later.  

          To send mail with input coming from keyboard, the general command 
          is: 
               mailx [opts] <uucp_address> 


















                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          To send a file, the command is: 

               mailx [opts] <uucp_address> < filename 

          or 

               echo test message !  mailx [opts] <uucp_address> 

          where 'filename' is the pathname of the desired file, 'opts' are 
          one or more optional command line arguments, and 'uucp_address' 
          is a user name or address which can take any of the forms 
          described next.  The last example shows piping text to mailx.  

          The address on a command line can take different three different 
          forms, for example: 

               mailx rick 

          Sends mail to 'rick'. 'rick' may be either an alias (see 
          ALIASES.DOC) or the name of a user on the local system.  

               mailx "apple!fico!central!rickadams" 

          Sends mail to the user "rickadams" using the "bang" (!) path 
          given.  --NOTE--: On the CoCo, the double quotes are necessary to 
          prevent Shell from trying to interpret the bang as a pipe 
          character.  Under OSK, a different means of quoting the '!' may 
          be needed.  Some shells use a backslash () to quote a character, 
          e.g.  mailx apple!fico!ccentral!rickadams.  Check in the docs for 
          the shell you are using under OSK.  

               mailx user@node     -- or --     mailx user*node

          The first address is given is a domain address.  The second form 
          is NOT a valid domain address.  However, for CoCos using Shell+ 
          v2.1, the second form is necessary for any user who is NOT the 
          superuser.  A security feature in Shell+ strips the "@" from any 
          command line arguments of non-superusers before they are 
          processed.  To get around the problem, Mailx will treat a '*' 
          internally the same as as the "@". There is a patch included in 
          the original Shell+ archive which lets you turn off the "@" 
          check.  If you have turned it off all users can use the properly 
          first form.  The second address form should not be needed under 
          OSK. This depends on how the OSK shell treats the '@' character.  

               mailx @filename      -- or --     mailx *filename

          This form tells mailx to look in the directory UUCP in the user's 
          home directory for a file called 'filename'. The contents of the 
          file will be interpreted as a mailing list.  Mailx assumes the 
          file is a list of user names, aliaes or UUCP addresses, one per 
          line.  The message will be sent to each address.  As mentioned 
          above, the "*" form is for non-superusers using Shell+ on the 
          CoCo.  




                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          Mailx is also smart enough to understand the Internet '%'. For 
          example: 

               mailx joe%sandstorm.uucp@gigsys 

          This will send mail to user 'joe' at sandstorm.  The message will 
          be routed via gigsys.  In order for this to work properly, users 
          of Shell+ v2.1 must turn off the shell variable expansion.  This 
          is done by: 

               OS9> -v 

          Or it can be done in the user's password entry file as in this 
          example: 

               bob,000000,0,128,/dd/cmds,/dd/usr/bob,ex shell -v 

          If the shell variable expansion is not turned off, Shell+ will 
          try to interpret the '%' as a shell variable and remove it from 
          uucp_address.  

          There is a special case local user name 'daemon'. The UUSETUP 
          program creates an entry for this user ID in the password file.  
          Any mail sent from this user ID will have a special header with a 
          'Reply-To: postmaster@<this_system>' address.  There is also a 
          special user name 'nobody' recognized by RMAIL. Mail sent to user 
          'nobody' will be sent to RMAIL's bit bucket.  

          Next, Mailx tries to open the file 'aliases' ('.aliases' under 
          OSK). If the file exists, Mailx attempts match each uucp_address 
          with an alias address.  If a match is found, uucp_address is 
          replaced with the appropriate address.  (See ALIASES.DOC for more 
          details on the aliases file.) Thus you can send mail to: 

               mailx fred barney mary 

          where 'fred', 'barney' and 'mary' are aliases for longer uucp 
          paths.  If no matching alias is found or the aliases file cannot 
          be read, the addresses remain unchanged.  In the example above, 
          Mailx would assume these are names of users on the system.  

          Mail aliases, uucp addresses and mailing lists may be mixed 
          freely on the command line.  This lets you send a single message 
          to mutilple recipients.  For example: 

               mailx fred "wingding!evil!purple!barney" @mail.list 

          When mail is sent from the keyboard, you will be prompted for a 
          "Subject:" line.  If no "Subject:" line is desired, hit ENTER to 
          skip this line.  

          Mailx reads the files /DD/SYS/UUCP/parameters and mailrc (.mailrc 
          under OSK) file in your home directory to get the default 
          parameters.  (See PARAMETERS.DOC, PARAMETERS.EXAMPLE and 




                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          MAILRC.DOC for information on the format of these files.)  If 
          'mailrc' is set to prompt for carbon copy (Cc:), Mailx will show 
          the line 'Cc:'. One or more names, uucp_addresses, or aliases 
          separated by a space can be entered.  A copy of the message will 
          be sent to each address as well as those given on the command 
          line.  If you don't desire to send a copy of the message, just 
          hit ENTER.  

          Mailx will now allow you to compose your message.  

          First, a bit of advice.  UUCP is text based system.  Because are 
          there are many different types of terminals which are used to 
          read UUCP mail on, it is poor practice to include graphics or 
          control characters or binary files in the message text and 
          certainly NEVER in the message headers.  Graphics and control 
          characters may do nice, fancy things on your terminal; however, 
          the things they do to the receiver's terminal may not be so nice 
          or fancy.  At the very least, you may make your mail unreadable 
          at the receiving end.  Binary files can be included in mail after 
          running them through a binary to text encoding program such as 
          UUENCODE or CUTS. UUENCODE is a standard UUCP encoding utility.  
          CUTS was written for the CoCo and unlikely to be found on other 
          UUCP systems.  

          Secondly, it is good practice to limit line lengths to less than 
          80 characters.  Each line should end of a carriage return.  You 
          can not assume that the receiver's terminal will properly handle 
          excessively long lines.  Your nicely formatted text may end be 
          hard or impossible to decipher on the receiver's terminal.  



                                   COMPOSING MAIL

          Initially, you are in OS-9's single line editor.  You can enter 
          and change text as long as you do not hit the ENTER key.  While 
          you are typing an outgoing message, there are various commands to 
          assist you in composing the message.  Each of these commands 
          starts with a tilde (~) character at the beginning of the line.  
          After each command is finished, with the exception of ~a and ~x, 
          you will be returned to OS-9's single line editor.  


          ~v                  Edit message using "vi". "vi" refers to the 
                              Tandy TSEDIT editor after the "vi" patches 
                              have been applied to enable this editor to 
                              work in OS9 device windows.  

          ~e                  Edit message using the editor defined in 
                              either by the environment variable EDITOR or 
                              the file mailrc (.mailrc under OSK) in your 
                              home directory.  The editor named in 'mailrc' 
                              overrides the one defined by EDITOR.  





                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          ~m[<char>]          Include text of letter being replied to.  An 
                              optional character <char> will be put at the 
                              beginning of each line.  The default 
                              character is ">". This can be changed in 
                              either 'parameters' or 'mailrc' files.  If a 
                              space is used as the character, no quote will 
                              mark the included text.  Examples: 

                                   ~m<SPACE>    This is included message
                                   ~m<ENTER>    >This is included message
                                   ~m-          -This is included message

          ~h                  Display help message.  

          ~x                  Exit Mailx immediately, abandoning letter.  

          ~r[<char>] <file>   Include text from file <file>. If an optional 
                              character <char> follows '~r', each line of 
                              the included text will be started with it.  
                              Mailx assumes <filename> is in your current 
                              data directory unless a full pathname is 
                              given.  Examples: 

                                    ~r <file>   This is included file.
                                    ~r$ <file>  $This is included file.

                              There is no default quote character for this 
                              command.  

                              Before appending the file, the file name is 
                              checked for an ending extention, e.g.  .ar, 
                              .lzh, etc.  If such an extention is found, 
                              Mailx attempts to compared against the names 
                              in the file /DD/SYS/UUCP/bin.list, if it 
                              exists.  This file consists of a list of 
                              names, one to a line, representing names of 
                              binary files.  Common names would be: ar, 
                              gif, pak, lzh, bin, z, vef, and gif.  
                              --NOTE--: The dot (.) is NOT part of the name 
                              in bin.list.)  If a match is found, Mailx 
                              assumes the file is a binary one and 
                              uuencodes it before appending it.  If the 
                              file is uuencoded, the quote char is not 
                              used.  If there is no match or bin.list 
                              doesn't exist, Mailx proceeds as described 
                              above.  

          ~R[<char>] <file>   Works the same as ~r above except no attempt 
                              is made to uuencode the file.  









                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          ~a                  Abort editing the current letter.  You will 
                              be asked if you want to abort.  Only a 'y' or 
                              'Y' will abort the letter.  If you were 
                              replying to a message, you will be returned 
                              to that message.  Otherwise Mailx will exit.  

          ~!                  Forks a shell.  CNTRL-<BREAK) will kill the 
                              shell and you can resume composing the 
                              letter.  

          ~u <file>           Uuencode <file> and append it to the letter.  



          When editing a message, DO NOT attempt to do any of the 
          following; the results are unpredictable: 

              o   Change the message header To: or CC: lines.  The changes 
                  will not be used when the mail is sent.  You can change 
                  the Subject: line, however.  

              o   Remove the blank line following the message header.  
                  Mailers on remote systems expect this blank line to be 
                  there and start with an End-Of-Line character 

          When you are finished composing the letter, you send it by 
          entering a period (.) followed by <ENTER>. The period must be the 
          first and only character on the line.  

          Mailx will then try to open and read either the file signature or 
          alt_signature, if the command line optin '-n' was used, in your 
          home directory.  The latter is discussed below.  If it exists, 
          the contents will be appended to the letter.  (See SIGNATURE.DOC) 

          If the mail cannot be sent to user, an error message will be 
          shown.  The message will be saved in the file dead.letter in the 
          user's home directory.  If dead.letter already exists, the 
          message will be appended to the file.  This feature will prevent 
          needing to retype a long message because of some addressing 
          error.  



                                COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

          Various command line options can be used for sending mail.  They 
          can be mixed in any order with addresses.  Each option must be 
          preceded by a '-'. Options may be run together, for example: 

               mailx -dps test bob@kc2wz.bubble.org 
               mailx oracle@cs.indiana.edu -s "Oracle tell me ..." -p -d 







                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          Available options are: 


          a <file>       file replying to.  This is used by POSTNEWS when

          s <subject>    Subject: line.  If included on the command, you 
                         will not be prompted for it later.  If the subject 
                         consists of more than one word, they must be 
                         enclosed in double quotes.  Example: 

                              mailx -s test harvey 

                         Sends a mesage to 'harvey' with: 
                              Subject: test 

                              mailx -s "This is a test" harvey 

                         Sends a message to 'harvey' with: 
                              Subject: This is a test 


          xN             N equals the debug level from 0 (OFF) to 9 
                         (highest). The default is OFF (0).  

          d              Tells Mailx not to add your signature file to your 
                         letter.  This is useful for sending mail to an 
                         automatic mail servers where unexpected text can 
                         cause unexpected results.  The default for this 
                         option is OFF. This means Mailx will read the 
                         contents of the signature (.signature under OSK), 
                         if it exists in your home directory, and append 
                         its contents to your message.  

          n              Look for the file alt_signature (.alt_signature 
                         under OSK) in your home directory.  If it can be 
                         read, its contents will be appended to your 
                         message instead of the default 'signature' 
                         ('.signature' under OSK).  

          p              Do not to prompt for carbon copy (Cc:).  This will 
                         override the setting in the 'mailrc' file.  It is 
                         useful for sending mail as in this example: 

                              echo "Time to backup" !  mailx -p paul 

                         The -p is necessary here.  Otherwise, if this 
                         command was run by a system daemon such as CRON 
                         and the 'mailrc' or the /DD/SYS/UUCP/Parameters 
                         file was set to prompt for 'Cc:', Mailx would wait 
                         for a response to the "Cc:" prompt which it would 
                         never see.  The result look like the Mailx had 
                         crashed.  





                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


                                 RECEIVING MAIL

          This section deals with reading mail received from other users or 
          remote UUCP systems.  Mail is read in the order it arrives.  
          Messages can read either starting with the oldest to the most 
          recent (first in, first out) order, starting with the most 
          recently to the oldest (last in, first out) order.  Mailx 
          defaults to first in, first out order.  

          The two commands to read mail are: 

               mailx 
               mailx -r 

          When mail begins you will be told the total number of messages 
          waiting, how many are new (received since the last session), and 
          how many are unread (new from a previous session but never 
          read).  

          If the message displayed is longer than the screen, the message 
          will stop scrolling and a "MORE" prompt will be displayed until 
          you hit one of the following keys: 

          x              Mailx will exit immediately with no changes.  

          q              This will display Mailx's command prompt: 

                              mailx> 

                         At this prompt you can use any of the commands 
                         described in detail in the next section.  

          a              This will redisplay the current message starting 
                         from the beginning.  

          n              This will stop showing the current message and go 
                         to the next waiting message.  If the current 
                         messsage is the last one, Mailx will ask if you 
                         want to quit.  The current message remains 
                         unchanged in either case.  

          p, -           This will stop showing the current message and go 
                         to the previous message.  If there is no previous 
                         message, the current message is redisplayed from 
                         the beginning.  


          BREAK          Mailx will exit immediately with no changes to any 
                         messages.  









                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          SPACE 
          ENTER          Continue scrolling the current message.  


          At the end of the message, Mailx's command prompt, "mailx>", will 
          appear.  At this point, you may dispose of the mail in a number 
          of ways: 

          s [<filename>]      Saves the message to a file.  <filename> is 
                              optional.  If none is give, the message is 
                              saved in a file called 'mbox' in the user's 
                              home directory.  If 'mbox' already exists, 
                              the message is appended to the file.  If 
                              <filename) is given, message will be saved 
                              that in file.  Mailx puts <filename> in the 
                              user's home directory unless a full pathname 
                              to somewhere else is used.  An error message 
                              is shown if Mailx is unable to save the 
                              file.  

                              You will then be given the option to delete 
                              the message.  Any answer but yes keeps the 
                              message.  

          w [<filename>]      Saves the message to a file as does 's' 
                              above.  However, the header is stripped 
                              first.  Mailx begins with line following the 
                              first blank line in the message.  A blank 
                              line is a line beginning with a carriage 
                              return or linefeed.  

          n                   Go to the next message.  The current 
          <SPACE>             message is unchanged.  If the current 
          <ENTER>             message is the last one, Mailx exits.  

          p, -                Go to the previous message.  If the current 
                              message is the first one, it is redisplayed 
                              from the beginning.  

          a                   Shows the current message again starting from 
                              the beginning.  

          r                   Reply to the message being read.  You will 
                              able to compose using the commands described 
                              in COMPOSING MAIL above.  After the reply is 
                              sent, you will be return to the command 
                              prompt.  The current message will be 
                              unchanged.  










                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          f                   Forward a copy of the current message to one 
                              or more addresses.  You will be prompted for 
                              "forward To:". Enter one or more names, uucp 
                              addresses, or aliases with a space separating 
                              each one.  If you decide not to forward the 
                              message, hit ENTER in response to "forward 
                              To:". If you have already typed addresses but 
                              not yet hit ENTER, simply backspace as far as 
                              possible and hit ENTER. In both cases, you 
                              will be returned to the command prompt.  

                              Next, you will be prompted for "Subject:". 
                              You can enter it or hit ENTER in which case 
                              the default "Subject:" will be "Forwarded 
                              Mail".  

                              A copy of the current message will be 
                              attached and you will end up in Mailx's 
                              single line editor.  You may either edit the 
                              message (See COMPOSING MAIL) or send it 
                              immediately.  The signature file is NOT 
                              appended to a forwarded message.  


          m <address>         Send mail to one or more UUCP addresses.  
                              Separate each address with a space.  End 
                              addresses with ENTER. If you decide not to 
                              mail, hit ENTER instead of entering 
                              addresses.  You will be returned to the 
                              command prompt.  

                              This command is essentially the same as using 
                              'mailx <address>' on the command line with 
                              two differences: 

                                   1. The current message being read is 
                                      available to include in the letter.  

                                   2. Non-superusers can use '@' instead of 
                                      '*' since the shell is not being used 
                                      inside Mailx. (Only Shell+ users on 
                                      the CoCo need to be concerned with 
                                      this.) 

                              You can also use the command line options, 
                              -s, -d and -p. These are only in effect to 
                              the duration of the 'm' command.  

                              After the mail is sent, you will be returned 
                              to the command prompt.  The current message 
                              will be unchanged.  







                                                                           




     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


          d                   Delete the current message.  You will be 
                              asked for confirmation.  Any answer but 'Y' 
                              or 'y' will leave the message unchanged.  

                              If you answer 'Y', the current message will 
                              be deleted and the next one displayed.  If 
                              this was the last message, Mailx will ask if 
                              you which to exit.  

          u                   Undelete mail deleted during this session.

          x                   Exits immediately leaving everything 
                              unchanged.

                              shell and return to the command prompt of the 
                              current message.

     MAILX                            UUCP                            MAILX


                                    CHECKING MAIL

          Mailx let's you check your mailbox to see if there is waiting 
          mail.  The command syntax is: 

               mailx -c [<user>...] 

          Only the superuser is allowed to check for waiting mail of other 
          users.  If a non-superuser attempts this, only their mailbox is 
          checked.  You will be told if there is waiting mail and how many 
          messages.  When the superuser checks another user's mail, the 
          superuser's mailbox is also checked.  Some examples: 

          User 'bob', who is not the superuser, is checking his mail:

          OS9> mailx -c
          You have mail <3 messages> ...type 'mailx' to read it
          
          OS9>

          Superuser 'sue' is checking her mail and that of 'postmaster' and 
          'fred': 

          OS9> mailx -c postmaster fred
          You have mail <1 message> ...type 'mailx' to read it
          
          postmaster: You have mail <2 messges> ...type 'mailx' to read it
          fred: no mail

     FILES   

          Use of $HOME and $MAIL below indicate directories defined by 
          environment variables.  For CoCo and OSK, the global environment 
          variables MAIL and HOME must be defined, e.g.: 

                 MAIL=/h1/usr/spool/mail
                 HOME=/dd/home


          In user's home directory:
