These are header files which this package needs for compiling on the CoCo.
Some of these were not on the original Microware C compiler disks.

stdio.h has a few changes from the Microware original file.  DIR in the
original file has been changed to _DIR to avoid a conflict in the dir.h file.

If you have modified your original MW DEFS files, check to make sure your
changes will not deleted before copying these replacements.
