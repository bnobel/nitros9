                Known bugs and "features" in UUCPbb package
                -------------------------------------------

MAILX
-----
    o On the CoCo, Mailx has an upper limit of about 185 messages.  If more
      message than this are waiting to be read, Mailx will abort with an
      error.  If termcap support is compiled in, the upper limit on the CoCo
      will be less than 185 message.

      Unfortunately, due to memory limitations on the CoCo, there may not
      be a way around this upper limit.

UUCICO
------
    o With some uucp hosts, UUCICO seems to get "lost" and hang.  This seems
      to occur with only a few hosts.  We are still trying to figure out the
      reason and a fix.

UUCP (the program)
------------------
    o Sending files from a host to a system running this package sometimes
      does not succeed.  Sending files from a system running to this package
      to another host seems to work without problems.  The cause of the
      problem appears to be in the file filexfer.c.  Right now we are still
      trying to squish this...umm..."feature".
