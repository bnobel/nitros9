A list of things to add or finish working on for the UUCPbb package.  These
are listed in no particular order.  If you wish to work on something or
contribute to the package, contact me.

  1.  UUSTAT -- The code is mostly done, but still has a few bugs to nail.

  2.  MAILX needs continue moving in the direction of more like UNIX's mailx.
  
  3.  FILSERV need to make it smarter. :-)  Right now it will attempt to
      send any size file in a single message.  This is "Not A Good Thing" (tm)
      to do.  Most systems bounce mail greater than 100K.  FileServ needs to
      split large files into smaller pieces for mail.

      The begins of the code to allow submitting files is there, but this
      feature is not yet implement.
      
      Allow mailing list to be run by FileServ.

  4.  UUCLEAN expand it so will scan the days uulog file and keep statistics
      on UUCP calls.  Be nice to know how many minutes you actually spent
      for a day's/week's/month's phone calls.

  5.  RMAIL allow regular expression parsing of addresses.  This would allow
      something along the lines of UNIX sendmail (though hopefully easier
      to comprehend :-) ).  Brad Spencer <brad@anduin.eldar.org> had some
      ideas.  If you want to try working something like this, contact Brad.
  
  6.  POSTNEWS needs to be fixed.  It still doesn't allow cross-posting
      a follow-up article to more than one newsgroup.  If the original
      article was posted to multiple newsgroups, your follow-up only goes to
      the group you are reading the article no.  Not good.
      articles
  
  7.  READNEWS can't think of specific things, but I'm sure y'all will. :-)
  
  8.  Feed news- UUCPbb do allow you to provide a news feed to anyone right
      now.  We are limited to only receiving news.  I would like to able to
      provide news feeds to someone "downstream" from us.

  9.  Protocols.  Currently only the 'g' protocol is supported.  I would like
      to try implementing the bi-directional 'i' protocol which Taylor (GNU)
      UUCP uses.  This should help cut down phone time. :-)
      
      gproto.c could use a little more robustness.  Boisy, Brad and I have it
      talking to different versions of UUCICOs we had access to.  When talking
      to DEC Ultrix on the CoCo, gproto.c sometimes gets lost when it drops
      some bits.  UUCICO eventually times out.  The code needs a little more
      tweaking so dropped bits don't always leave the CoCo twiddling its
      registers. :-)

  10. Working with BBSs.  I have not have any opportunity to getting UUCPbb
      and the various OS-9 BBSs programs to work together.  No reason why it
      can't be done.  If you do it, send along your work!

  11. Other ideas?
