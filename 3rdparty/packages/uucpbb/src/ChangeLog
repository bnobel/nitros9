UUCPbb --Changes, bug fixes, etc.

Changes made to Rick Adams original UUCP source v4.2 to create UUCPbb were
made by:
       Bob Billson (REB)   <bob@kc2wz.bubble.org  or ...uunet!kc2wz!bob>
       Tom Kocourek (TK)   <tomk@westga3.dragon.com>
       Brad Spencer (BAS)  <brad@anduin.eldar.org>
       Boisy Pitre (BGP)   <boisy@os9er.waukee.ia.us>
       Jeff Shepler (JS)   <sysop@miliways.aldhfn.org>
       Eddie Kuns (EK)
       Bob R. Taylor (BRT) <bob@qtpi.lakewood.ca.us>

1991 May 25
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Used newer version of getopt() in some of the files.  Adds a bit more
         parsing flexibility.  (see getopt.c and getopt.h)
     o Changed int and char global variables to direct page globals to add
         some speed to the code on the CoCo.

1991 Jul ??
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Added s, d, n options to command line.  
     o Changed way local mail is saved.  New format keeps messages as
         individual files in separate mail directory for each user.
     o Enhanced mailcmd() to add save and forwarding mail.

1991 Jul 19
     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Rewrote validaddr() to properly parse domain style addresses:
         user@node.domain.

1991 Aug ??
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Added p option.

1991 Aug 2
     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Added support for internet '%' addressing:
         user%site2@site2.domain1.domain

1991 Aug 19
     --uuxqt.c (REB)
     o Added support for Mark Griffith's uucico package where all spooled
         files are kept in one directory.
     o Used docmd() to load/unlink rmail and rnews instead of
         modload()/munlink().  The latter often cause problems.

1992 Apr ??
     --uucico.c (REB)
     o Changed many global variables to direct page for 6809 to make code
          slightly faster.
     o Changed -r option.  UUCICO defaults to running as master.
               -r says to run as a slave.
     o Changed logging to /DD/LOG/uulog file.  Messages which previously
         were sent to the screen, now get logged to uulog.

     --filexfer.c (REB)
     o Added logging incoming/outgoing files and errors to
         /DD/LOG/uulog file.
     o Changed code to try opening/creating the file to be sent/received.
         If this fails, the transfer is refused.

1992 Apr 20
     --findwork.c (REB)--
     o Combined files findwork.c, dowork.c and slavework.c into one file.

     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Added support to check for an alias before attempting to deliver mail.

     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Changed makefile to remove stack checking from compiled code.  This
         adds a noticeably increase in speed.  CAUTION: the file malloc.c
         MUST be compiled separately to a .r file.  It needs the stack
         checking code to work properly.

1992 Apr 21
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Made doalias() a separate file.  Limiting the size of the aliases file
         by reading the whole thing in, doalias() checks the file and
         returns the alias, if found.  doalias() also allows comment lines.

1992 Apr 24
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Changed method of generating a unique sequence ID in genseq.c
     o Removed the need for original getnode.c module.
     o Changed docmd.c to create docmd(), docmd_na() and added dochcmd.c to
         the file.
     o Changed getsu() and dropsu() in code to asetuid() from Carl Kreider's
         CLIB.L.

     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Fixed bug in parse_addr() which would crash mail if there was an
         '@list' on the command line.
     o Kludgy patch for Shell+ v2.1 users.  Shell+ strips '@' from command
         line of non-superusers.  So addresses such as: user@node become
         usernode.  A '+' in place of the '@' allows non-superuser to do:
         user+node which is internally changed to 'user@node'.  Kludgy but I'm
         not about to fix Shell+. :-)

1992 May ??
     --newsutils.c (REB)--
     o Changed global variables to direct page for 6809
     o Add support to log info to /DD/LOG/uulog file.

     --openuucp.c (REB)--
     o Added support for logging to uulog file.
     o Functions return values indicating success or failure.
     o Added SystemIsOK().  Checks to see if remote calling in is a valid
         system.  Ends call if it is not.
     o Improved recv0() and send0().

1992 May 1
     --doscript.c (REB)--
     o Added longjmp() so readport() returns to highest level if the remote
         does not respond after a timeout period.
     o Added sending/receiving control characters to send(). The form ^J will
         send CNTRL-J to the remote.
     o Various functions return values reporting success or failure

1992 May 6
     --closeuucp.c (REB)--
     o Changed mcloseuucp() and scloseuucp() to shutdown connection
         smoother and return error value if it doesn't.

     --findwork.c (REB)--
     o Added support for longjmp().

1992 May 7
     --dotilde.c (REB)--
     o Fix buglet where ~m[char] didn't work properly.  Made a single default
         quote character definable in user's mailrc file.
     o Added ability to fork a shell while composing mail.

1992 May 8
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Added setjmp()/longjmp() support so errors from lower level are
          handled better.
     o Added getopt() to better handle command line parsing.
     o Added option to allow uuxqt to run at a different priority then               uucico does.

     --gproto.c (REB)--
     o Added longjmp() to uucico.  Fatal errors go there rather then just
         exiting.
     o Modified Calc_Chksum() to give assembly version a tad more speed.
         We can use all we can get on the CoCo. :-)
     o Changed rdmsg() and getpacket() so it retries bad packets without
         giving up so easily.
     o Changed code in gproto(), master() and slave() to simplify it.
     o Added fix to swin_flush() suggested by Rick Adams to handle unexpected
         packet types.

1992 May 10
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Added ability to read mail forwards or reverse order, read message
         again, or previous message.
     o Added ability to handle mail coming from local system daemon.
     o Added ability to fork a shell when reading or sending mail.

1992 May 30
     --openport.c (REB)--
     o When port is open all ports parameters are turned off.  Original values
         are save and restored when the port is closed.
     o Combined original hangup.c with closeport() in this file.

1992 June 2
     --getparam.c (REB)--
     o Added support for parameters:
         'realname'  in /dd/usr/<whoever>/mailrc
         'pager'     in /dd/usr/<whoever>mailrc
         'errorsto'  in /dd/sys/uucp/Parameters
         'modemrest' in /dd/sys/uucp/Parameters
         'newshost'  in /dd/sys/uucp/Parameters
         'hangup'    in /dd/sys/uucp/Parameters

     o Fixed bug in Daylight Savings Time routine.  DST starts the first
         Sunday of April not the last.

1992 Jun 9
     --postnews.c (REB)--
     o Changed command line argument parsing to use getopt().
     o Added signal handling, so postnews cleans up after itself on keyboard
         interrupts.
     o Changed method of generating a unique sequence ID.

1992 Jul ??
     --rnews.c (REB)--
     o Minor changes to use getopt() from Carl Kreider's CLIB.  Added support
         for logging errors to /DD/LOG/uulog file.

1992 Jul 5
     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o RMAIL exits with:  0    if mail was successfully delivered
                          4    if mail could not be delivered and was bounced.

1992 Jul 10
     --openport.c (REB)--
     o Added support for system call SS_HNGUP which is supported by most new            ACIA drivers such as Bruce Isted's DACIA and SACIA.  Modem will hang
         up by dropping DTR or +++ATH method.  This is settable in the
         /dd/SYS/UUCP/Parameters file and supported by getparam().

1992 Jul 13
     --postnews.c (REB)
     o Added default newshost option to parameters file.

1992 Jul 14
     --uuxqt.c (REB)--
     o Added system name 'ALL' (upper case only).  If this "system" is passed,
         uuxqt will attempt to process mail/files for all the systems listed
         in the /DD/SYS/UUCP/Systems file.

1992 Jul 20
     --readnews.c (REB)--
     o Added ability to fork a shell from the command prompt.

1992 Jul 31
     --findmach.c (REB)--
     o Changed findmach() so it returns a value indicating whether or not a
         successful connection was made.
     o Added support for uulog file.

     --connect.c (REB)--
     o Added code so connect() returns a value indicating whether the
         connection succeeded or failed.
     o Added support for log file, uulog.

1992 Aug 2
     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Added code to dolocal() and movemail() to update 'mail..list' file in
         local user's mail directory.

1992 Aug 8
     --openport.c (REB)--
     o Removed support for ttylock()/unlocktty() I added. It isn't needed

     --findwork.c (REB)--
     o Combined findxwork.c and doxwork.c into one file.
     o Added logging to /DD/LOG/uulog file
     o uuxqt will not try to delete work files if RNEWS or RMAIL can't
         successfully process the file.

1992 Aug ??
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Added new commands to support multiple calls to multiple remotes.
     o Rewrote processing loops to support multiple calls.
     o Added screen display to show call progress for when uucico run from the
         keyboard instead of CRON.
     o Added signal handling for smoother keyboard aborts.
     o Added new commands to support multiple calls to multiple remotes.
     o Rewrote processing loops to support multiple calls.
     o Added screen display to show call progress for when uucico runs from
         the keyboard instead of by CRON.
     o Added signal handling for smoother keyboard aborts.

1992 Aug 25
     --readnews.c (REB)--
     o Replaced gets() with mfgets().  Prevents nasty crashes since gets()
         does not check for buffer overflow.

1992 Aug 30
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Added memset() to getmsg().  This ensures that the address and
         replyto arrays are cleared.  Sometimes they were not and part of the
         address would get chopped.

1992 Aug 31
     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Added "bit bucket".  Mail addressed to local user 'nobody' is dumped
         in the bit bucket.

1992 Sep 1
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Replaced gets() with mfgets().  mail.c and postnews.c  Prevents nasty
         crashes since gets() does not check for buffer overflow.
     o  Cleaned up makefile

     --postnews.c (REB)--
     o  Added signal handling to postnews for cleaner exits when <BREAK> is
          used.

1992 Sep 7
     --filexfer.c (TK)--
     o Added fix to look for Unix transfer address "~/receive/user/node" in
         ssendfile().  Keeps uucico from hanging in case our public directory
         name doesn't match the remote's.

     --newsutils.c (TK)--
     o  Added fix to readactive().  Previously readactive() didn't check to
          see if MAXNEWSGROUPS was exceeded.

1992 Sep 14
     --openport.c (REB)--
     o Added support for hardware (RTS/CTS) or software (XON/XOFF) flow
         control.  This takes advantage of Bruce Isted's SACIA/DACIA
         replacement for AciaPak.

1992 Sep 27
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Fixed minor bug so mail..list file is set to the proper owner in
         rebuildmail().

1992 Sep 30
     --readnews.c (REB)--
     o Fixed a bug in newscmd() where a Subject: line containing double quotes
         (") would munge the address line when replying to or following up an
         article.  All double quotes are changed to single quotes (') before
         sending.

     --rnews.c (REB)--
     o Changed so returns an error (ABORT in uucp.h) if any problems occur.
         This informs UUXQT not to remove the related work files.  Errors
         might be related to damaged files or insufficient RAM to uncompress a
         compressed batched file.  Previously, UUXQT would assume RNEWS was
         always successful.
     o Removed code in main() after the for (;;) loop.  Since loop never exits
         this code is never executed.

     --findwork.c (REB)--
     o Changed findxwork() to use Kreider CLIB opendir() and readdir()
         functions
     o Fixed bug where work files would occasionally be deleted.

     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Fixed minor bug in docmd_na() (docmd.c) to return a proper error if
         os9fork() fails --REB

1992 Oct 1
     --findwork.c (REB)--
     o Changed findwork() to use opendir() and readdir() from Kreider CLIB.

1992 Dec 18
     --uucico.c (TK)--
     o Fixed logging function as follows: 1) debug >0 & < 6 goes to screen.
         Debug 6-9 go to log file. -- TK

1992 Dec 20
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Minor mod of TK's logging fix.  All logging goes to uulog file unless
         the -z option is used.  In this case, logging works as described
         under 1992 Dec 18.

1993 Mar 7
     --uucico.c (BGP)--
     o Added -q (quiet) option to prevent printing anything to standard
         output.

1993 Apr 5
     --dotilde.c (REB)--
     o Help screen for keyboard user pops up in a double window.

1993 Apr 10
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Broke mail into three parts, mail.c, recvmail.c and sendmail.c to make
         it easier to handle.

     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Added code to dolocal() and movemail() to update mail..list file in
         user's mailbox directory.

1993 Apr 19
     --recvmail.c (REB)--
     o Added reverselist() to improve handling of reading mail in last in,
         first out order.

     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Improved the handling of double-linked list while reading mail.
     o Mail now properly handles Resent-To:, Resent-Reply-To:, Resent-From:
         and Resent-Date: fields.
     o interrupt() now only tries to unlink rmail if we loaded it. 
         Previously, it would unlink it even if someone else loaded it.

     --sendmail.c (REB)--
     o Added extract_orig_header() to get header info when forwarding a
         message.
     o Added Resent- fields for forwarded mail.

1993 Apr 20
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Fixed bug in uulog.c which caused the wrong uulog to be displayed.
         occasionally.

1993 May 3
     --uuxqt.c--
     o uuxqt will first check to see if another uuxqt is running; if it is, a
         signal will be sent to first uuxqt informing it of newly arrived
         work.  uuxqt catches all signals.  If a signal 128 is receive, then
         new work is waiting.  Since there no way to know who the work is
         from, uuxqt assumes a system name of 'ALL'.  The new mail is handled
         after the current batch is processed.

1993 May 5
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Moved sysOK() to openuucp.c and renamed it to SystemIsOK()

     --openuucp.c (REB)--
     o Moved sysOK() from uucico.c and renamed it to SystemIsOK()

1993 May 11
     --readnews.c (REB)--
     o Added to improved error messages to uulog.

1993 May 12
     --dotilde.c (REB)
     o Took Boisy's suggestion to display only the first few lines of a file
         when appending or quoting long text.  Added code to show file size as
         well. This is done in appendtext().

1993 May 22
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Added support for Boisy's non-shareable SCF patch.  Now uucico dies
         if the port is already in use.

     --openport.c (REB)--
     o Added support for Boisy Pitre's non-shareable SCF patch.

1993 May 26
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Mail can now be undeleted.
     o Changed parsing algorithm in parse_addr().

     --recvmail.c (REB)--
     o Added undelete (u), save without header (w), exit without change (x)
         commands to mailcmd().

1993 Jun 1
     --connect.c (REB)--
     o Added passing variable 'index'.  This permits uulog to identify
         which phone line was called with a multiple line remote.

1993 Jun 2
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Improved updating of mail..list file in rebuildmail(). Additional
         information is now stored in mail..list: message status, file name,
         From:, Subject:, line count and file size.
     o Added updatemail_list().

     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Added code to update mail..list with message's line count and size.

1993 June 3
     --recvmail.c (REB)--
     o Added gathermail().  malloc()s an array for the double-linked list.
         Displays new and unread mail count at start-up.

     --newsutils.c (REB)--
     o Fixed readactive().  If the active file is left open by another
         process, readactive() will wait until the file is closed or the user
         cancels sending the article.

1993 Jun 6
     --uuxqt.c (REB)--
     o uuxqt now assumes that any non-option command line argument is the
         name of a remote system.  The older -s <system> is still accepted.
         A system name of 'ALL' overrides individual system names.

     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Removed need for -s option to denote system names.  Now any command
         line argument not part of an option is assumed to be a remote
         systems's name.

     o Fix bug where endcall() sometimes printed the "Connection Failed"
         message twice.

1993 Jun 8
     --newsutils.c (REB)--
     o Added code to sleep for a few ticks if active file is being used by
         another program.  This prevents rnews from aborting processing an
         article.

1993 Jun 10
     --readnews (REB)--
     o Added code to display a double window help screen for keyboard users.
     o Added w command to save article to file without header.

1993 Jun 11
     --readnews.c (REB)--
     o Changed error logging so log file isn't kept open all the time
         preventing other programs from getting at uulog.

1993 Jun 16
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Add Boisy's update to uuencode to make it more like it's Unix
         counterpart.
     o Fix a print error in uudecode.  Previous uudecode would print out a
         "No begin line" after decoding a file.

1993 Jun 28
     --readnews.c (REB)--
     o Fixed minor bug where top line of an article sometimes scrolled off
         the screen.

1993 Sep 2
     --recvmail.c (REB)--
     o Added -v option to toggle using file viewer to display mail.
     o Fixed bug in mailcmd() where replying to a message twice without
         re-reading the message would cause the last letter in the address to
         get chopped.

1993 Sep 3
     --mail.c (BAS)--
     o Fix recvmail.c to prevent any user from overwriting another user's
         existing file when saving a message.
     o Fix so tempfiles can be accessed when a non-superuser doesn't have
         write permission to all the directories in the path.

     --sendmail.c (REB)--
     o Added Brad's support for separatesym variable in getparam.c.

     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Added support for forward file to add users incoming mail to be
         forward to another machine.
     o Added Brad Spencer's (BAS) support for address in the form...
         user%ournode.uucp@somewhere.else

1993 Sep 13
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Code now looks for parameters, mailing lists, signature,
         alt.signature, aliases and related file in the subdirectory
         pointed to by the global 'uudir' defined in uucp.h

1993 Sep 14
     --findmach.c (REB)--
     o Replaced calls to parse() with getargs().  If field parsed is
         is a set of double quotes (""), the character | marks the field.
         This keeps the routines in connect.c happy.

1993 Sep 15
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Replaced parse() with getargs() in filexfer.c, mail.c, rmail.c,
         findxwork.c.

1993 Sep 19
     --doscript.c (REB)--
     o readport() now returns FALSE if it times out and TRUE if the reading
         was successful.

1993 Nov ??
     --rmail.c (BGP)--
     o Added fix so movemail() correctly copies message's header.

1993 Nov 11
     --getdirs.c (REB)--
     o New parameters 'newsdir', 'pubdir', 'spooldir'.  Different programs
         now use getdirs() to read the Parameters file to get the appropriate
         directory info.  This has two advantages: 1) cut the code size for
         the CoCo, 2) make setup more flexible for the end user.

     --getenv.c (REB)--
     o Attempt at environmental variables for the CoCo.  Global environment
         file is /dd/sys/profile.  Contained in this file are the default
         system environment:
                  HOME=<home directory>
                  EDITOR=<default editor>
                  MAIL=<mail directory>
                  TERM=coco3

         Only HOME and MAIL cannot be changed by the user.  Each user has an
         optional file 'profile' in their root home directory.  They can be
         customized anything but HOME and MAIL.  This attempt should suffice
         until we get real environment variables on the CoCo.  OSK users
         already have this.  They will still have set MAIL and EDITOR if
         necessary.

1993 Nov 18
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Package renamed to UUCPbb after get OK from Rick Adams to release it
         to the OS-9 community.  Official release will be v2.0.

1993 Nov 27
     --openport.c (BGP)--
     o Fixed bug where SLAVE's sg_baud was not being copied to the new path
         descriptor.

     o Fixed how SLAVE's standard I/O path is open.  Previously, port was set
         to 0.  Should fix problems with UUCICO not taking incoming calls.

1993 Nov 29
     --dotilde.c (REB)--
     o Added '~u <filename>' option.  <filename> will be uuencoded and
         appended to the end of the message file.
     o Modified '~r' to check for extensions indicating binary files.  If a
         file ends with a '.???', such as .ar, .lzh, etc., will be compared
         against those give in /dd/sys/uucp/bin.list.  If a matched is found,
         the file will be uuencoded first.  If no match is found, the file is
         appended unchanged.

1993 Nov 29
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Fixed buglet in expire.c which occasionally left a zombie uulog file on
         the RAM disk.

1993 Nov 30 
     --sendmail.c (BGP)--
     o Fixed bug.  If you hit <ESCAPE> when sending mail, the screen would
         erase the previous line.

1993 Dec ??
     --filexfer.c (BAS)--
     o Fixed bug in filerecv().  Test to see if the received file is already
         there before trying to copy it.

     --gproto.c (BAS & BGP)--
     o Added fixes for Ultrix, Taylor and talking to another OSK/CoCo.

     --openuucp.c (BAS)--
     o Added fix if port is standard in, then arrange for send0() to write to
         standard out.

     --findwork.c (BAS)--
     o  Redid some of findwork() and added anywork().

     --miscellaneous (BGP)--
     o Added OSK and termcap additions.

1993 Dec 24
     --dotilde.c (REB)--
     o Made into a stand-alone program which is called by MAIL or POSTNEWS as
         needed.  This helps reduce the size of MAIL and POSTNEWS on the CoCo.

1993 Dec 27
     --connect.c (REB)--
     o Replace modem string test if{} with  ? : operators to clean up code in
         doscript().

1993 Dec 27
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o uuclean should now compile under OSK.  Undeliverable mail should now
         properly returned to the sender with an error message.         

1993 Dec 28
     --getparam.c (REB)--
     o Some major changes to Parameters file.  'modemerest' above is gone
         (unneeded).  'editor' is now expected to be an environmental variable
         (see getenv.c and getdirs.c).
     o getparam() returns the line a parameter error occurs in.

1994 Jan 1
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Removed file getname.c.  Seems unnecessary since the Parameters file's
         'realname' does the same thing.

1994 Jan 2
     --openport.c (JS)--
     o Reset string is read from the line in the Dialers file (third field).
         This should fix a modem initialization bug Jeff Shepler discovered.

     --gproto.c (REB)--
     o Moved globals rseq, sseq, swin declarations from uucico.c to gproto.c.

1994 Jan 11
     --miscellaneous (REB)
     o Ran entire source through UNIX lint and cleaned up problems found.

     --doscript.c (REB)--
     o Combined doscipt.c into connect.c as part of cleaning up.

     --connect.c (REB)--
     o Combined doscipt.c into connect.c as part of cleaning up.

1994 Jan 12
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o  Moved chatscript, dialscript declarations to connect.c

1994 Jan 13
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Final beta test ready!

1994 Feb 12
     --miscellaneous (BGP)--
     o strdup.c:  Cast malloc to type (char *).
     o osk.c: Added uIDtoInt().  Returns an integer value of the GID/UID
          string, i.e. "30.122".  For OSK only.
     o validuser.c:  Added call to uIDtoInt() for OSK.

     --rmail.c (BGP)--
     o Fixed a bug where paths with a single element (i.e. /h0) were screwed.

1994 Feb 21
     --openport.c (BGP)--
     o Added _gs_rdy() to flush port when it opened and closed.  This avoids
         the problem of modem messages such as NO CARRIER left over from a
         previous call.

1994 Mar 13
     --openuucp.c (REB)--
     o Fixed recv0() so it would only return NUL-terminated strings which
         start with the DLE character.  This fixed a problem where uucico
         would not talk to the MS-DOS program UUPC [sic].  The fixed was
         borrowed from Taylor (GNU) uucico.
     o Improved handshaking and error messages in mopenuucp() and sopenuucp().
         Also borrowed from Taylor uucico.

     --closeuucp.c (REB)--
     o Improved closing down the UUCP connection cleanly.  The method was
         borrowed from Taylor uucico.

1994 Mar 30
     --adduser.c (BGP)--
     o Few changes so we run properly choose the group and user IDs under
         OSK.
     o Added -s to allow super user ID (IDs under OSK) to be chosen on the
         command line.

     --miscellaneous (BGP)--
     o Fixed uucp.h to work with either Ultra C or v3.2 compilers as well
         as the OS-9/6809 C compiler.
     o Fixed potential serious bug in osk.c
     o Created separate makefiles (makefile.ucc and makefile.c32) for use
         with either Ultra C or v3.2 compilers.

1994 Apr 1
     --miscellaneous (REB)--
     o Final(!!) check out in preparation for releasing to the OS-9 Community
         on April 2.

     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Removed termcap support for uucico.c. Not really need and it causes
       some problems with OSK v3.2 compiler.

1994 Apr 4
     --It's out the door at last!!--

1994 Apr 5
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Oops..removed #ifdef TERMCAP/#endif code.  No longer needed.

1994 May 3
     --uucp.h, uucico.c, gproto.c (TK)--
     o #define END in uucp.h conflicts with #define END in stdio.h.  To fix
       this, END was changed to _END in uucp.h, uucico.c and gproto.c

     --os_misc.h (TK)--
     o OS-9000 uses _fileno() rather than fileno().  Added a #define to fix
       this problem.

     --proto.h (TK)--
     o Declare fdopen() properly.  Keeps OS-9000 happy. :-)

     --miscellaneous (REB)
     o At Boisy's suggestions nmload(), nmlink(), nmunload(), nmulink() used
       in the various sources were changed from testing the returned value by
       using != 0, to == -1.

1994 May 7
     --rmail.c (REB) --
     o Fixed problem of single line messages with no signature not sent under
       OSK.  Added 'fflush (mailfile);' just before the line
       'return (linecount);' in the function movemail().

     o Fixed a bug Bob Brose discovered.  Previously, if the Subject: line
       appeared before the From: line in the header in local mail, the
       mail..list would have the Subject: field left out.

1994 May 8
     --strstr.c (BGP)--
     o The Ultra C compiler already has a strstr() function.  Added an
       #ifndef _UCC so strstr.c does get added in.

     --findmach.c (BGP)--
     o Line 75 reads:
          fprintf ("Wrong time to call (%s)", sysname);

       should be:
          fprintf (log, "Wrong time to call (%s)", sysname);

1994 May 15
     --expgroup.c (EK)--
     o Eddie's update of expire makes if much MUCH faster.  Thanks Eddie!

     --gproto.c (EK)--
     o Fix bug in so sliding windows work properly.

1994 May 23
     --getline.c and ngetline.c (REB)--
     o Replaced with an updated version from Bob Taylor.  Prevents a lock up
       problem he noticed.  The code is a bit more efficient or at least it
       looks better. :-)

1994 Jun 1
     --uucico.c (BGP)--
     o Variable 'priority' was set at startup.
     o Wrong max priority comparison in OSK.

1994 Jun 2
     --uucico.c (BGP)--
     o Updated so priority variable is not use as a flag, too.  This also
       eliminates pflag as the first parameter of do_uuxqt() and also the
       variable priorityflag.

1994 Jun 4
     --readnews.c (REB)--
     o Colin McKay spotted a bug were 'mail' rather than 'mailx' was being
       forked when replying to a news article by mail.

1994 Jun 14
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Fix typo in do_uuxqt() which prevent uuxqt from being forked with -q
       (quiet) option.

1994 Jun 15
     --osk.c (BGP)--
     o Fixed uIDtoInt() to properly return the UID value.  Previously, the
       upper limit was 256 when it should be 65536.

1994 Jun 18
     --rnews.c (BAS)
     o Totally rewritten.  A LOT faster and no more articles getting scrambled
         in the wrong newsgroups!  (THANKS BRAD!)

1994 Jun 19
     --mail.c (REB)--
     o Fix bug in checkmail(), where -c option did not return the status of
       other users' mailboxes if the superuser had no mail waiting.

1994 Jun 28
     --rmail.c (REB)--
     o Fixed bug discovered by Scott McGee and Boisy, where writing to log
       file would occasionally cause crashes.  A related bug also prevented
       error messages from getting written to the log file.

     --sendmail.c, readnews.c, postnews.c (REB) --
     o Fixed bug where hitting <ESC> (cntrl-<BREAK> on the CoCo) at some
       prompts would send mailx, readnews or postnews into a nice loop.  Now
       if you hit <ESC>, except when requested to, the programs will exit
       immediately.

     --ngetline.c & getline.c (REB)--
     o getline.c has been changed to return the number of characters read
       as ngetline.c did do.  getline.c now returns -1 on EOF.  Previously,
       it return EOF.  All the code using either getline or ngetline was
       changed to use the new getline.c.

1994 June 30
     --readnews.c (JS)--
      o Fix bug where readnews was passing the full pathname to the article
        to postnews instead of just the filename.

1994 Jul 12
     --fileserv.c (REB)--
     o Added 'reply <address>' command to fileserver.  Replies will be sent
       to this address instead the one extracted from the message header.

1994 Jul 13
     --osk.c (BGP)--
     o Fix a bug in the function popen(), where os9fork() rather than
       os9exec() was used.  This bug caused the fileserver to be anti-social
       on OSK boxes.

1994 Aug 2
     --openport.c (BGP)--
     o Fix openport() so the port is opened in the non-shareable mode under
       OSK.  Other programs trying to access the port when uucico is running
       should get an error 253 (non-shareable file busy).

1994 Aug 5
     --uucico.c (REB)--
     o Fix bug in do_uuxqt() where uuxqt was not passed the -q option
         properly.

     --connect.c (REB)--
     o Added sending a line break to send().  This allows \K or BREAK to be
         used in chat scripts.
     o Added sending end-of-transmission character.  EOT in a chat script is
         used to send this.
     o Added detecting modem response of "NO DIAL TONE".  Hayes compatible
         modems should send "NO DIALTONE".  Not all modes are fully Hayes
         compatible.  (My US Robotics 14.4KB Sportster, for example.)

1994 Aug 30
     --connect.c (BRT & REB)
     o Added \p to send().  This allows a 1/4 second pause in the dial and
         chat scripts.

     --docmd.c (BRT)--
     o Changed os9fork to os9forkc and open paths from 32 to 3.

     --dumpcode.c (BRT)--
     o Added logging of K value of packets.

     --readnews.c (BRT)--
     o Added lines and columns from termcap.
     o Moved getscreensize() to AFTER getting termcap info.
     o Added w+ to fopen newsrc file.
     o Added reverse video to prompts.
     o Fixed problem with too many lines printing.

     --makepath.c (BRT & REB)--
     o Fixed problem with Unix/OS-9 filenames.  Unix allows + and -.  While
         OSK allows only -.  (Level 2 doesn't normally allow either --REB).
         + is changed to __ locally.  - is changed to _ on CoCo.

     --termio.c (BRT)--
     o Made termcap buffer 2K for large termcap entries.  Linked with GNU
         termcap library to handle them.

1944 Sep 5
     --uucico.h (REB)--
     o Created this header file for uucico files to simplify maintenance.

1994 Sep 22
     --misc (REB)--
     o The directory containing the log files in now defined by the
         environment variable LOGDIR.  Other than the /DD/SYS/UUCP directory,
         there are no other hard-coded directories in the package.  Everything
         is now user settable.

     o User's mailrc (.mailrc for OSK) has a new optional parameter
         'fullheader'.  This allows Mailx to default to display a full or
         shortened message header.  Format is 'fullheader = <value>', where
         <value> is either 'yes', 'no', 'on' or 'off'.

     --recvmail.c (REB)--
     o New command prompt option 'z'.  Allows toggling the message header
         mentioned above.

1994 Sep 28
     --misc (REB & BGP)--
     o Final compiling check for official release.

1994 Sep 30
     o UUCPbb v2.1 is out the door!
