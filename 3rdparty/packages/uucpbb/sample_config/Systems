# Systems file - UUCPbb v2.1
#
# Format:
# <system_name> <schedule> <device> <baud> <phone> <chat_script>
#
# Notes:
#   - Lines starting with a #, <space>, <tab> or <cr> character are considered
#       comment lines and ignored.
#
#   - At least one whitespace (<space> or <tab>) must separate each field.
#
#   - Each system entry must contain only one <cr> at its end.
#
#   - UUCICO uses <system_name> to identify the host to call or let call us.
#
#   - <system_name> MUST start in the first column.  System names cannot be
#       more than 8 alphanumeric characters.  Punctation is not allowed in the
#       system name.
#
#   - <schedule> is the day(s)/time(s) we are allowed to call the system.
#       This field consists of two subfields DAY and TIME.  These have no
#       spaces between them.  The DAY subfield is specified using the
#       following keywords (case is unimportant);
#
#         Any           -we can call at any time
#         Never         -we should never call but wait to be called
#         Wk            -call any weekday (Monday-Friday)
#         Su,Mo,Tu,We,  -call on individual days
#         Th,Fr,Sa
#
#       The TIME subfield is specified by two 24-hour clock times separated by
#       a dash (-) representing the span of allowed time.  For example,
#       0930-1100, call only between 9:30 and 11:00 in the morning.  More than
#       one DAY/TIME can be included by separating them with commas.
#       Examples:
#
#         Wk1230-1545,Su,Sa  -call Monday-Friday from 12:30 to 3:45 in the
#                               afternoon and any time on Saturday and Sunday.
#         Any1800-2000       -call any day from 6:00 to 8:00 at night
#         Any                -call any day, any time
#         Th                 -call any time on Thursday
#
#   - <device> field is refers to entry in the 'Devices' file.
#
#   - <baud> is the maximum speed we will use to talk to the remote.
#
#   - <phone> is the full number we need to call the remote
#
#   - <chat_script> are alternating pairs of strings starting with the
#       expected response from the remote and what we send.  A space separates
#       each expect or send string.  Normally, a newline character is sent at
#       the end of every send string.  This can be overridden with the \c
#       character.  If we to indicate not to expect or wait for a response a
#       pair of double quotes ("") can be used.
#
#   - Special chat script characters are:
#       ""    -send or expect nothing
#       EOT   -send end-of-transmission character (hex 04)
#       BREAK -send a line break
#       \b    -send a backspace character (hex 08)
#       \c    -suppress sending a newline character at the end of SEND string
#       \d    -delay 1 second
#       \K    -send a line break
#       \n    -send a newline character, i.e. linefeed (hex 0A)
#       \N    -send a NUL character (hex 00)
#       \p    -pause a fraction of a second
#       \r    -send a carriage return (hex 0D)
#       \s    -send a space (hex 20)
#       \\    -send a backslash (\) character
#       \t    -send a tab character (hex 09)
#       \xxx  -collapse the octal digits xxx into a single ASCII character
#                and send that character
#       \[    -send escape character (hex 1B)
#       \^?   -send a control character where ? is replaced with appropriate
#               character, e.g. \^A sends control-A
