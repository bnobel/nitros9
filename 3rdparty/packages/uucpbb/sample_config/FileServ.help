At the moment, the fileserver is rather simple.  There are five commands:
reply, help, dir, get, and quit.  Commands and filenames may be either upper
or lower case.  The Subject: line is ignored.  Commands are sent in the
message body, one to a line.

                             Command summary
                             ---------------

reply <address>   Send all replies to <address> instead of the one given in
                  the mail header.  This must be the first command in the
                  message body; otherwise it is ignored.

help              Gets you this file.

dir               Returns a list of available files.

get <filename>    Gets the file <filename> and sends it back to you.  If the
                  file is binary, it will be uuencode before sending.

quit              Stops command processing.  Any lines after this line are
                  ignored.
