# Dialers file - UUCPbb v2.1

# Format:
#   <dialer_name> "" <modem_reset> <expect1> <modem_dial> <expect2>
#
# Notes
#   - Lines starting with #, <space>, <tab> or <cr> character are considered
#       comment lines and ignored.
#   - <dialer_name> is referenced by the fifth (last) field of the Devices
#       file.
#   - The second field is always an empty string, i.e. "" or a '-'
#   - <modem_reset> is the string we send to our modem to reset it.  On a
#       Hayes compatible modem this is usually ATZ or ATZ0.
#   - <expect1> response message from the modem.  On a Hayes compatible modem
#       this is often 'OK'.  If a pair of double quotes ("") is used, no
#       response is expected.  Any received is ignored.
#   - <modem_dial> is the commands necessary to actually dial the remote.
#   - \T tells uucico to insert the phone number given in the Systems file at
#       this point.
#   - <expect2> response message the modem sends when the two modems are
#       finally connected and ready to go.  On Hayes compatible modems this
#       is usually 'CONNECT xxx'.  The string 'CONNECT' is sufficient.
#   - When a direct physical connect (no modem) is used between machines,
#       fields 2 through 6 are empty strings, i.e. pair of double quotes (""),
#       or dash (-)
