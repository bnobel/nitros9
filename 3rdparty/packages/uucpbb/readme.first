The file COPYING is the GNU General Public License.

The DOC directory contains both doc and man pages files for the UUCPbb
package.  These files are formatted, ready-to-print on standard 8 1/2 x 11
inch paper, 66 lines per page.  There are no printer control codes embedded
in any of the files.

Please READ the documentation.  It will, I hope, make installing the program
easy.  If you find mistakes or unclear areas in the docs, please let me know.
I don't like documentation that is unclear.  While I am not a writer by
profession, I would like to make the files as useful as possible.  If they
are unclear, they are not very useful.

The SAMPLE directory contains various files which go in the /DD/SYS/UUCP when
you are instructed to copy them there.  You should edit these files to
conform to YOUR system.  The file UUCPBB.DOC will explain what to change.
Each file contains an explanation of the file's contents.  It is not necessary
to delete this information after you finish installing UUCP.


The MISC directory contains the following archives:

SCF14.AR is Boisy Pitre's patch for OS-9/6809 Level 2 to allow SCF devices
to be made non-shareable.  Instructions for applying the patch are contained
in the archive.

MCRON12.LZH is Boisy Pitre's multi-user version of CRON for OS-9/6809.
Instructions are contained in the archive

CONVERTPALM.LZH is Jeff Shepler's utility for use with his mailer, Palm.  If
you are running Palm with Rick's original UUCP on the CoCo, use this utility
to convert Palm's mail to the new form used by UUCPbb.

UUTOOLS.LZH is a version of uuencode and uudecode which allows large files to
split into smaller files.  Many UUCP will reject mail files larger than about
100K.  UUE (uuencode) allows you easier send a large file in smaller pieces.
UUD (uudecode) allows you to put these pieces back together and decode than
without a lot of hassles.  Only the OS-9/6809 executables are in this file.
Put these in your execution directory with names uue and uud.

UUTOOLS_SRC.LZH is the source for UUE and UUD.  It includes makefiles for
the OS-9/6809 and OSK versions.  Put the executables in your execution
directory with the names uue and uud.

CM.LZH is a mail monitor for use with UUCPbb under OSK.  It runs in the
background and checks for new mail at regular intervals.  This utility
was contributed by Boisy.  Questions or suggestions about it should be
sent to him.

DESKTOP.LZH was also contributed by Boisy.  The archive contains some AIF/icon
files for a particular GUI on the MM/1 called Desktop.
