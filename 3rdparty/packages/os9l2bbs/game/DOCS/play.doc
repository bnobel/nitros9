                Game Play Documentation

  The following text is intended to explain the commands at
your disposal.  What you do with them is entirely up to
YOU!

  Galactic is played on a grid-work system, setup by the
sysop.  You might want to think of it as a large box,(clus-
ters), with smaller boxes inside,(sectors).  You explore
each cluster/sector by using the NAV command.  If you wish
to change the cluster your in, you use the JMP command,
which will take you to another cluster with new sectors.
  This version does not have a actual winner, but should
be ended by the sysop when one of the players has attained
the rank of Admirial Admirial.  This will prevent each game
from continuing to long and boring the players to death.

  To get a list of commands during game play use the "?"
at the command prompt.


COMMANDS EXPLAINED!


NAV or nav
 Moving from sector to sector.  When nav is used you will
be prompted first for the direction.  The directions are:
                      8 1 2
                      7 ^ 3    the ^ is your position
                      6 5 4
You will select the direction you wish to go by entering
a number 1 thru 8 and pressing enter.  The next prompt will
be WARP or the distance you wish to go.  This will depend
on the number of warp units that YOU have available.  You
will enter the number of sectors to go 1 thru MAX and press
enter.  You will arrive at the new sector and recieve a
short scan of that area.

STA or sta
 Your current status.  The sta command will print your
total status,(credits,items in stock,bases,loan,etc...).

TRA or tra
 This command is only available when in an OUTPOST sector.
When used you will find yourself in the center mall with
a menu selection.  This is where you will sell the cargos
that you find for credits!  Other options will be Buy,
this is where you can spend the credits or go to the bank
to pay on your loan, deposit or withdraw funds.  HINT:
don't apply for a loan if you have a current one.  You
will be disapointed.  

WAR or war
 War can only be used for war on enemy,(other players),
bases.  When bases are found and you wish to take them
over, you type war and press enter.  You will then be
asked for the number of fighters you want to deploy.
The number can be from 0 to the MAX you have.  War with
other Fleets and M-Units,(see LRS), is automatic.

LRS or lrs
 In your travels you will want to see whats ahead, and
where.  You will use your Long Range Scanners,(lrs),
to look for dangers.  When you first start playing you
will not have any and will need to buy some at the out-
post.  Some of the items you will see are:
 $  These are your bases, which are income and where
    you must end your turn.
 P  This represents planets.  Planets can contain cargo,(
    from 0 to 6), enemy bases or..........
 #  This is an enemy fleet. (remember auto-war)
 
 S  Stargate.  Used for teleporting fleet anywhere in that
    cluster.
 M  M-Units can be very dangerous.  Their power is ranked
    by class,(1-9).  The formula for an M-Unit is:
    Class X Cluster number = fighters released.
 ?  Your scanner is getting mixed signals and can't compute
    what's there.
 :  Dead space outside cluster.
Beware the Klingons.  They will not show on any scan!

SRS or srs
 This command is used automatically and not used manually, 
but is available at the command prompt

BUI or bui
 This command is used to BUILD the bases from the basekits
that you have in stock.  The maximum you can build is the
same as the cluster number if you have enough in stock. You
cannot build where something already exists, except cargos.
Hint: the more bases you have the more income$$$!

JMP or jmp
 When you wish to explore another cluster type jmp and
enter.  You will be prompted as to where you want to go.
You cannot change your mind after using jmp!  You MUST
choose a cluster number even if it's the same your on.

TLP or tlp
 When you land on a STARGATE sector you can then teleport
to any coordinate inside or outside that cluster.  This is
a quick way to get to an outpost.

GET or get
 When you find a planet with cargos you load them into your
cargobays with the get command.  You can only load 10 per
each starship you have.  If there are more on the planet
than you have space, you can still use get to top off your
bays.  The left-over cargos will be left on the planet.

LST or lst
 If you want to see a list of game players type lst and 
enter.  You can see all or part, you will be prompted.

CAL or cal
 To see a list of the last 9 players use cal.  You are the
10th player so no need list that one.

TOP or top
 Top will give you a list of the top 5 players.  As long
as there are some with a positive total worth!

END or end
 If you wish to end your turn before you run out of moves,
then use end.  You will be given a second chance after you
enter end,(just in case).  In order to save some credits, 
you may wish to end on one of your base planets, otherwise
you must build,(bui), a base.  If your not close to your 
base or you have none in stock, don't worry the bank has
you covered!  They will tack any additional charges to your
loan.


Additional note:
 Players will not be allowed to play "back to back".  There
must be at least one player in between each login!
