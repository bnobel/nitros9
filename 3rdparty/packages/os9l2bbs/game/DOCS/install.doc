     Welcome to the OS9 Version of Galactic Conflict.

     The Original Galactic Conflict programmed by Paul
Alger, was written under RS-Basic.  And released to the
public thru the November '87 issue of Rainbow Magazine.
It could be run from your keyboard or with the help of
Remote2 it could then be operated via the modem, with BBS
software or it would operate as a stand alone program.  One
of the problems with the original was that it was large and
needed all the memory your computer had.  And with two
amateur programmers such as J. Sebella and M. Gaskins,
enhanced the program to a point that no more pokes and
execs could give them more memory.  Thus the only other way
was to rewrite the game under Basic09.  This way we could
take advantage of more memory and modularity.  Galactic
Conflict Journey II is the result of 1 year of work.
Although work will continue to improve the game it will
currently only run on a Coco 3 with 512K.  
What follows is roughly what you will need to run and
play  ---===< Galactic Conflict >===---

CREATING GALACTIC:
STEP 1

After your sure of where you want the game to reside, (/d0,
/d1, /h0, etc...), create a directory called FILES.
** If your running a bbs the data files can reside 
anywhere.  But make sure that the CHD is changed to where
you want them to be.

STEP 2

You will need to change your data
directory to files by typing  chd /d?/FILES
Then type    creategame    and follow the prompts.

STEP 3

Next you need to copy a text file named  newcmds  to the
files,(data), directory.  This file may be edited with a
word processor if you wish.

STEP 4

There needs to be,(for now), a dummy file called rules.
This is just a simple text file that can be generated by
using the build,(OS9), command or by using a wordprocessor.
We included a one line text file that says "no rules avail-
able".  You can copy that one or make one of your own in
the files,(or data), directory.


FIRST RUN OF GAME:
STEP 1

Galactic is able to handle upto 40 players.  Since this is
the first run of the game, there are no users as yet so you
will need to register.  You might like to use an 80 column
window for yourself.  To execute the game you will need 
to make sure that your data directory is set to files, by
typing  chd /d?/FILES.  And your execution directory is in
the commands directory where game is located by typing
chx /d?/cmds.  Now type game and your drives will wirrrr
for a few seconds.

STEP 2
At the prompt: Are you a new user? Enter a Y or y to
register.  Follow the prompts and answer the questions.

NOTE:  We thought better of opening the game to new users, 
so although your registered you will not be permitted to 
play until your verified and a password is entered.

WARNING!
For some reason, the first time the first,(registered),
player tries to log in to play, you will get an error.
The error is an error 211 or end of file encountered.
This is not fatal just type game again and all will be
fine and the error will not occur again.  We will try to
find out why and correct it in future versions.


USING THE PLAYER EDITOR
STEP 1

Future versions of the game will let the sysop know if
anyone has registered, but, until then you will need to
manually check to see.  This is where the file called:
Edit2 is used.  It can be used to look at each players file
or to edit/verify new or old users name, game name, or
password.  To use the editor make sure that your data
directory, (chd), is in FILES.  And your execution
directory, (chx), is in the cmds directory where
Edit2 is.  Type   Edit2  and follow prompts.

NOTE: An editor was not included on the original game.  We
created one.  We also created one for this version.  So 
please take heed, that the SYSOP of the game will need to
be an honest,(hahaha), person, because of the information
that will be displayed.

EDIT MODE:
In edit mode the only 3 fields you can edit are the players
Real Name, Game Name, or Password.  When a player
registers, the password field is used for his phone number.
This is the one way you can tell new users.  Maximum Field
Lengths are: Real Name = 15 characters
             Game Name = 10 characters
             Password  = 10 characters
All passwords must be in uppercase letters!  Once a player
has created a record by registering, that record CANNOT
be deleted.  One option for unruly users is to give their
record to someone else by changing the password and names.


VIEW MODE:
This mode will "display only" ALL data in the selected
players record.

Both Edit and View modes are logically prompted.



FINALLY:

In the original game there was a command for listing the 
rules.  We didn't need them because we kept changing them
anyway.  In this version the command RUL or rul is
available but not printed to the screen in the newcmds
list.  If you wish you can use a wordprocssor to create a
file called rules.  It must reside in the FILES directory.
Then use the wordprocessor to add the new command to the
command list.  The command list is called newcmds, and it's
also in the FILES directory.  A word of warning, if the
file rules is not there and you type RUL the game will error.
              **********************
As an added EXTRA for BBS Sysops!  We included a module
called newstat.  It will give a user the game status and
the last caller without having to go into the game.  The
module needs to be in the CMDS directory and the CHD where
the data resides.
