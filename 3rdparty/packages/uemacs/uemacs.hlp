Instalation:

Os9/68000: 
  Vt52: rename uemacs.mak to makefile and use make.
  Other: Modify makefile to use appropriate terminal module (i.e. ansi)
        rather than the vt52 module.

Os9/6809: See uemacs.mak to see what modules are needed.

Known Problem:
  The 68000 version seems to have problems editing large (or many small)
files (long before memory is exausted).  The malloc routine apperently 
does not work well for many small allocations.
