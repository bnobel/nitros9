Summary:



     These files are the best I could do to get 'microEMACS' for OS-9
'here'.  This is the now legendary Bob Santy/Bob Larson port which time
and luck have conspired to keep out of the hands of most OS-9'ers.
As it is, it's being brought to you from Usenet, to my Color Computer,
to BIX, to Bob Santy, to Bob Larson, to me, to BIX again, to my
Spectravideo CP/M machine, to 'lsuc', to the net.  That's only part
of the story and doesn't even go into the *days* I wasted just trying
to upload it from my Color Computer to 'lsuc' and other fiascos.

     Please, someone, use it.  That's make me feel much better about
the whole mess.

                                           Cheers! -- Jim Omura
