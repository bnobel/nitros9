These are the original files from Pascal 2.0 as distributed by Dragon
Data under license from Microware.

If you want to run it under real OS9 remember to change NL to CR for
the text files CMDS/PascalErrs, PascalDefs and optionally Dumpreal.

Some of these files are Pascal PCODE and hence can't be disassembled.
