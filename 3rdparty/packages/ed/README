The Unix ed-editor ported from Minix to OS9 Level One.

Old UNIX-hands will recognize this simple editor. What makes this editor
still relevant is that it fits in the memory space of OS9 Level One,
it is completely independent of terminal command sequences and it can
be fed instructions from a script.

To build it on OS9 type:

shell compile
shell makelib
shell makeed
