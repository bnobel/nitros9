Though RunB (the I-CODE interpreter) came on the OS-9 disks,
Basic09 was not distributed as part of the OS-9 system.
You had to purchase it separately. I therefore considered it
more appropiate to treat both applications as a united
3rd party package.

The Basic09 I own was purchased from Dragon Data Ltd. They
had changed the welcome message, but otherwise I think it
is exactly the same Basic09 as was distributed by Microware.
This Basic09 is the basic09-d64.asm file.

A slightly different Basic09 was found in the level2 directory.
This Basic09 is the basic09-cc.asm file.
