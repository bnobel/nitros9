These disk images were given to me by Brother Jeremy on Saturday,
April 16th 2005 at the Chicago CocoFEST! in Elgin, Illinois:
update2.dsk
upgrade1.dsk
utility.dsk
windisk.dsk

This disk image was purchased by Boisy Pitre at a ChicagoFEST sometime in 1999 or 2000, by Brother Jeremy who was selling the two disk Level 2 V3 Upgrade.
I was not able to get the second disk to read properly, so only the image
of the first disk is available:
l2v3d1.dsk
