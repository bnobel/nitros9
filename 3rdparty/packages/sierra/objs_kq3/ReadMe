Disassembly of the Sierra King's Quest 3 interpreter

The files here are not used, all games instead use objs_lsl/* 
(originally from Leisure Suit Larry), but the folder is kept for
reference.

The KQ3's interpreter was the first to be disassembled and seems to
contains more comments than the LSL one.
