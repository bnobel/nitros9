This is a quick set of utilities I use to save myself time for either testing or convenience.

cls - this is a quick clear screen utility that display sends a $0C to the current stdout.

fast - this strobes $FFD9 to enable turbo mode of the CoCo 3.  Useful for re-enabling fast mode after using slow.

slow - this strobes $FFD8 to enable normal 0.89MHz mode on the CoCo 3.  This is useful for testing older L1 programs and other nifty stuff.

Hopefully someone will find these of some use in their projects.
