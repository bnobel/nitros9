OS-9 LEVEL ONE V2.00.00 SOURCE ARCHIVE

LEVEL I:
System and User programs in system memory.  The Coco 1 & 2 and Dragon
64 ran OS-9 with both the system and user programs executing out of the
same 64K memory map.

This directory contains the source to OS-9 Level One Version 2.00.00 as
sold by Radio Shack for the Tandy Color Computer.

FILE ORGANIZATION
Sources and bootfiles are separated into the following directories:

	DISKS/        ..... Disk images of disks 1 & 2 of OS-9 Level One
	CMDS/         ..... Source for all commands on disks 1 and 2
	MODULES/      ..... Source for all modules on disk 2
	BOOTFILES/    ..... Bootfiles generated from the MODULES and CMDS
                            directories
	DEFS/         ..... Definition files from OS-9 Level One disk
	SYS/          ..... System files from OS-9 Level One disk

BUILDING
Typing 'make' will build modules and command binaries from the sources
in the CMDS/ and MODULES/ directories, as well as bootfiles in the
BOOTFILES/ directory.

DISK IMAGES
The disk images in the DISKS/ directory are provided for reference during
disassembly and commenting.  They are zipped, and the contents can be
accessed using the os9tools package on www.sourceforge.net.

CHANGES
Thus far, the only modules that differ from the original Tandy distribution
are the clock module and the date command.  Both have been modified to handle
Y2K issues properly.
