**************
* LSNMap
* Take physical LSN and convert into SDHC/SD/MMC LSN
* SD/MMC uses a 32 bit byte mapping for the LSN, so we must shift the logical LSN up one bit
* and then clear the 4th byte to build the correct LSN string
* SDHC uses a 32 bit 512 byte sector mapping for the LSN.So there is no need to shift the LSN
* we can just write it as is and clear out the upper LSN byte, because we only get 3 bytes from coco for LSN
* does not preserve Reg A
