**** OS-9 Level One VR 02.01.00 'Phoenix' Release Notes ****

This release of OS-9 Level One for the Tandy Color Computer and
Dragon computers represents the first community-based release
since the discontinuation of both the CoCo and Dragon in the 1980s.
Its codename is an obvious parallel: Phoenix.

There were several reasons for releasing a new version of OS-9
Level One:

	o It was long overdue (16 years)

	o Year 2000 fixes were needed

	o Bringing both CoCo and Dragon OS-9 to the same code base
	  was desirable

	o This release served to test our methods for assembly and
	  packaging, which will come in handy as we continue to
	  work on future possible releases of this and other versions
	  of OS-9

One goal of this release was to consolidate commands and modules from
both the CoCo and Dragon versions of OS-9 into a single distribution
that would support both systems.  The last CoCo version of OS-9
Level One was version 02.00.00, released in mid-1986.  The last Dragon
version of OS-9 Level One was version 01.02.00, released ????.
The CoCo version of OS-9, being newer, was the basis for this upgrade,
and the Dragon distribution disk reflects the newer OS-9 modules from
the CoCo version.

This goal was accomplished in tandem with another goal: bringing some
commonality to commands between OS-9 Level One and OS-9 Level Two.  The
CoCo 3 version of OS-9 Level Two was released in February 1987, about
one year after CoCo OS-9 Level One Version 2.  While some commands
are Level Two specific, most commands can interoperate in both environments,
and we felt it would be of benefit to "upgrade" Level One to some of these
commands.  We even went as far as to back-port certain commands like
os9gen and cobbler from Level Two, because they offered increased
functionality.  Level Two-specific code was conditionalized out and
Level One code was introduced.  The obvious benefit for us is that
we can now build a Level One and Level Two command from the same
source file.
