NitrOS-9 V03.02.07 Release Goals TODO
=====================================
VTIO
	- Fix init/term bug (only seen if windowing system is successively
          brought up/torn down).  This a long-standing bug, but doesn't impact
          the typical user.  More of an irritant than anything else.
	- Backport along with keydrv, joydrv, snddrv to Level 1.

ioman
	- Backport to Level 1

rbf
	- Backport to Level 1

format
	- Add option to allow formatting of Dragon disk format.
	BGP, 01/15/08:
	Is this needed?  format.asm builds for the Dragon port
	to allow formatting a Dragon disk.  So the Dragon version of NitrOS-9
	has its own 'format' executable, as does the CoCo version.
    
rb1773
	- Fix SS.WTrk to handle high density drives (is this working now?)
	- Fix SS.WTrk bug which causes crashes on some CoCos (I believe the
	  slowdown was employed as a temporary workaround?)
	12/16/05:
	Using a Disto Super Controller I hooked up to a 6309 CoCo 3, I
	booted to V03.02.04 and formatted /d1 which is a 5.25" 360K drive.
	I experienced the same computer lock-ups that others have seen.
	12/17/05:
	With the same setup that I made the above discovery, I made
	a new system disk with the latest code, the only thing being
	different was rb1773.asm which I retrieved from the repository
	at revision 1.10, the same revision that was part of V03.02.04.  I
	did a physical format on a 360K disk SIX times without any lockups.
	I then reverted to the format that was part of V03.02.04 and again,
	SIX physical formats yielded no lockups.

	Finally, I reinstated the latest rb1773 and format, then modified
	rb1773.asm to not slow down and speed up the CoCo 3 around the
	SS.WTrk code.  Six physical formats did not show a single lock-up.

	Conclusion: Further research is needed to warrant what caused this
	bug in V03.02.04.  It does not appear to be related to the driver
	directly, nor to the format utility.  It may be related to the
	kernel since that component has changed since V03.02.04.  At this
	point and time, further testing of the latest repository is needed
	to confirm on other systems that this bug no longer exists.

	- Add code to select MPI slot where disk controller is (can assume
          slot 4 or allow the value to be placed in the descriptor)

scf
	- Backport to Level 1

wordpakii
	- Adapt source to act as CoWP module to VTIO
	  (Phill-Harvey Smith said he would tackle this... Phill?)

os9gen
	- Add the -q option for quick linking of bootfiles

All boot modules
	- Handle fragmented bootfiles
	  (boot_1773 is done, others need to be modified and tested)
