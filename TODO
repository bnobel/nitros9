NitrOS-9 V03.02.06 Release Goals

cc3io
	- Fix init/term bug (only seen if windowing system is successively brought
	  up/torn down).  This a long-standing bug, but doesn't impact the typical
	  user.  More of an irritant than anything else.

rb1773
	- Fix SS.WrTrk to handle high density drives (is this working now?)
	- Fix SS.WrtTrk bug which causes crashes on some CoCos (I believe the
	  slowdown was employed as a temporary workaround?)
	- Add code to select MPI slot where disk controller is (can assume slot 4
	  or allow the value to be placed in the descriptor)

wordpakii
	- Adapt source to act as CO80 module to CCIO
	  (Phill-Harvey Smith said he would tackle this... Phill?)

format
	- Fix bitmap wipeout bug (DONE)

dir
attr
	- Use SS.FDInf to get FD sector information instead of raw access (DONE)

os9gen
	- Add the -q option for quick linking of bootfiles

All boot modules
	- Handle fragmented bootfiles
	  (boot_1773 is done, others need to be modified and tested)

rbf (Level 1)
	- Add SS.FDInf so that new dir and attr will work
