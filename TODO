To-Do:
  o Remove CoCo 3 Hi-Res calls from VDGInt and put in separate module.
    This will prevent users from having to have VDGInt in memory when
    playing games that use the SS.*Scrn calls.

Bugs:
  o 'CC3IO Deiniz Bug' -- This bug manifests itself if the last window
    device is terminated and initialized.  Since this doesn't normally
    happen due to the windowing system always being active at boot-up,
    this isn't a high priority bug.

  o Some CoCo 3s crash during formatting.  Robert Gault has found a
    workaround: bring the CoCo 3 speed down to .89MHz during the
    SS.WTrk call.

Ideas for the future:
  o We may want to back-port the cc3io-type architecture (keydrv, snddrv,
    joydrv) to NitrOS-9 Level 1.
