NitrOS-9 V03.02.06 Release Goals

TODO
====
VTIO
	- Fix init/term bug (only seen if windowing system is successively
          brought up/torn down).  This a long-standing bug, but doesn't impacth
          the typical user.  More of an irritant than anything else.
	- Backport along with keydrv, joydrv, snddrv to Level 1.

ioman
	- Backport to Level 1

rbf
	- Backport to Level 1

rb1773
	- Fix SS.WrTrk to handle high density drives (is this working now?)
	- Fix SS.WrtTrk bug which causes crashes on some CoCos (I believe the
	  slowdown was employed as a temporary workaround?)
	- Add code to select MPI slot where disk controller is (can assume
          slot 4 or allow the value to be placed in the descriptor)

scf
	- Backport to Level 1

wordpakii
	- Adapt source to act as CoWP module to VTIO
	  (Phill-Harvey Smith said he would tackle this... Phill?)

os9gen
	- Add the -q option for quick linking of bootfiles

All boot modules
	- Handle fragmented bootfiles
	  (boot_1773 is done, others need to be modified and tested)
