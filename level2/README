OS-9 LEVEL TWO V3.00.00 SOURCE ARCHIVE

This directory contains the source to OS-9 Level Two as modified
by Kevin Darling, et al.  This is the infamous "upgrade" version.

FILE ORGANIZATION
Sources and bootfiles are separated into the following directories:

	DISKS/        ..... Disk images of disks 1 & 2 of OS-9 Level Two
	CMDS/         ..... Source for all commands
	MODULES/      ..... Source for all modules
	BOOTFILES/    ..... Bootfiles generated from the MODULES and CMDS
                            directories

BUILDING
Typing 'make' will build modules and command binaries from the sources
in the CMDS/ and MODULES/ directories, as well as bootfiles in the
BOOTFILES/ directory.

DISK IMAGES
The disk images in the DISKS/ directory are provided for reference during
disassembly and commenting.  They are zipped, and the contents can be
accessed using the os9tools package on www.sourceforge.net.

CHANGES
This source archive reflects the changing state of this upgrade, and it is
expected that the sources will change as features are added to this "upgrade"
verison.
