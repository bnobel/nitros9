"Hello Darling"
Words and music (C) 1995 by Brother Jeremy, CSJW

** SUNG **
Hello Darling,
it's been a long time.
Since you worked on Level 2 OS-9.
But I'm begging you now,
please hear my plea.
Kevin, Darling,
set the upgrade free.

Well I spoke to Kent Meyers today.
Mark Griffith, he gave his okay.
Bill Dickhaus said,
that the contract was dead.
It expired back in 93.

So I'm leaving it all up to you.
And you know what I hope you will do.
So I'm begging you now,
please hear my plea.
Kevin Darling,
set the upgrade free.

** SPOKEN **
Last night as I sat by the screen,
I must have been having a dream.
For what did I see,
on the old CRT,
but the words OS-9 Level 3.

** SUNG **
So I'm leaving it all up to you.
And you know what I hope you will do.

So I'm begging you now,
please hear my plea.
Kevin Darling,
set the upgrade free.

So I'm begging you now,
please hear my plea.
Kevin Darling,
set the upgrade free.
