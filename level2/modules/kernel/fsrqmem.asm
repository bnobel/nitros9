**************************************************
* System Call: F$SRqMem
*
* Function: Request memory
*
* F$SRqMem allocates memory from the system's 64K address space in 256 byte 'pages.'
* There are 256 of these '256 byte pages' in the system's RAM area (256*256=64K).
* The allocation map, pointed to by D.SysMem holds one byte per page, making the
* allocation map itself 256 bytes in size.
*
* Memory is allocated from the top of the system RAM map downwards.  Rel/Boot/Krn
* also reside in this area, and are loaded from $ED00-$FFFF.  Since this area is
* always allocated, we start searching for free pages from page $EC downward.
*
* F$SRqMem also updates the system memory map according to 8K DAT blocks. If an
* empty block is found, this routine re-does the 32 entries in the SMAP table to
* indicate that they are free.
*
* Input:  D = Byte count
*
* Output: U = Address of allocated memory area
*
* Error:  CC = C bit set; B = error code
*

* IMPORTANT!!!
* The following code was put in some time back to fix a problem.  That problem was not documented
* so I cannot recall why this code was in place.  What it appears to do is reset the system page
* memory map based upon the state of the system DAT image.
* This code really slows down F$SRqMem and since that system call is used quite often in the system,
* I am commenting it out in the hopes that I can remember what the hell I put it in for. -- Boisy
