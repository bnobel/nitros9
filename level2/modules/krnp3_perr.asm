*    Commercial use of this program, which was written for fun to share with

*    Please share any extensions or modifications with the author, who
*    would be interested in hearing about them.
*
*  NOTE
*    Quick poll... how does the above sound as a copyright notice?  Clearly,
*    authors like to share their work while maintaining some control on it.
*    And it doesn't seem fair for someone else to make $ from something
*    someone else made for fun.  I think the above conditions are what most
*    people want.  Let me know what you think.
*
*  NOTE
*    The inspiration for this utility was the os9p3 example in
*    the Tandy Level II manual.  Tandy deserves praise for
*    including examples such as this one in their manuals.
*
*  NOTE
*    There is something funny about OS9p3 modules... some versions
*    are not liked, others are.  When developing this module, often
*    a version would fail... but if I added a "leas 0,s" right before
*    the "rts" in PrinBuf, it would work!  Probably the location and
*    operation are not significant.  This version here has never failed
*    to boot on my system; however, if it does on yours (or you change
*    it), try putting such things in.
*
*  NOTE
*    For those people who just can't have enough... OS9p3 will look for
*    a module called OS9p4, and link to it, and execute it.  Thanks to
*    Kev for this idea.  Now we can keep additions to the kernel in nice
*    separate chunks.  (How long 'til OS9p11 comes around...?)
