*
* Alan DeKok's version of RAMMER - Based on original Keving Darling version
*
* NOTE: For some reason, when DEINIZing /r0, the INIT routine gets called...
*       but it still deallocates memory!

*   5      2000/03/14  L. Curtis Boyle
* Several changes
*
*   5r2    2000/05/09  L. Curtis Boyle
* Allowed driver to go past 400K, attempted some fixes for handling /MD,
* so that setting vfy=0 on /R0 would not completely crash the system.
* Fixed some error reporting bugs that would crash the system, and
* moved entry table to between READ/WRITE to allow short branches to both.


* Following CAN be set higher, but will take another page of system RAM then.
* 200 will allow maximum of 1,638,400 byte RAM drive.
MAXBLOCK set   201         Maximum # of MMU blocks allowed in RAM drive
