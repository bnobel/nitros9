OS-9 Level One V2.01.00 Beta2:
- Defs files now have properly terminated lines and 'pag' is now emitted
  as a comment.
- SCF, Rammer and PipeMan are now made from the NitrOS-9 version source base,
  bringing in new improvements and features from that platform.
- Clock and Clock2 are now unifed once again and are built from the same source
  base as the clocks from NitrOS-9.
- The printer driver is now for the CoCo 3 serial port.  In the previous release,
  it was mistakenly made for the Disto parallel port.
- ASM now assembles 6309 op-codes.
- Window descriptors now have proper initialization count.
- The following modules have been back-ported from NitrOS-9 in order to
  unify the code base and bring non-6309 specific features to OS-9 Level Two:
- The debug program is now part of the CMDS package.
- With the inclusion of NitrOS-9's SCF, a bug which crashed the system when
  typing CTRL-E or CTRL-C while using shellplus has been fixed.
