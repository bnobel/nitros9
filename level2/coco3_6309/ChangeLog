  back-ported kernel.
- keydrv and snddrv have been renamed to keydrv_cc3.sb and snddrv_cc3.sb,

  improvements in extended output.
OS-9 Level Two V03.01.04:
- rel has been back-ported from NitrOS-9 Level Two, adding 40 and 80
  column boot screen options.
- asm is now at edition 8 and includes the following fixes/additions:
  o Symbols now allow underscores.                                
  o The "parens error" bug has been fixed.
  o Added support for case-sensitive symbols with the U option flag.
  o Improved 4-digit year fix for date/time string.              
  o Automatic conversion of tabs to spaces on input.             
- A bug accidentally introduced into os9gen related to boot track on
  double-sided disks has been fixed.
- The directory structure of the Modules disk has been modified.  All
  modules and related files are now under the LEVEL2 directory.
- There are now two versions of cc3go: cc3go_h0 which performs chd/chx
  to /H0 on startup, and cc3go_dd which performs chd/chx to /DD on startup.
- The MD descriptor has been added to the LEVEL2/MODULES/RBF directory.
- A compatibility issue with os9gen's -t option and OS-9 Level One     
  has been resolved.

OS-9 Level Two V03.01.03:
- The asm program now supports 6309 bitfield instructions.
- The prompt command has been added to the standard command set.
- os9gen now supports the -t= option which allows one to specify an
  alternate boot track file.
- Two new directories have been added: BOOTLISTS and BOOTSCRIPTS.
  The former contains bootlist files for building boot disks, while
  the latter contains scripts to build boot disks.
- There are now two booters for booting from a WD1773 based
  floppy controller: boot_1773_6ms and boot_1773_30ms for
  6 and 30 millisecond step rates.
- The M1 device descriptor now references the SACIA driver.
- The help utility has been enhanced to show help subjects if
  forked without any command line parameters.

OS-9 Level Two V03.01.02:
- A bug in the help utility has been fixed.
- Drivers and descriptors for Tandy's Hard Disk Interface have
  been added to the MODULES directory.
- The MODULES directory structure has been enhanced to include
  multiple subdirectories for better module organization.
- Booter modules for Burke & Burke, Disto RAMPak, Eliminator and 
  IDE-LBA have been added.
- The BOOTLISTS/ directory has been added on the Modules disk, and
  contains bootlist files for various configurations.
- The cputype command has been optimized for size.
- Slight performance modifications were made to RBF and SCF.
- More commands have been added to the merged utilpak1 file.
- Minor help file updates have been made.

OS-9 Level Two V03.01.01:
- SYS/helpmsg expanded to include new commands.
- ident now correctly reports modules with a language byte of Obj6309.
- rbf.mn has been back-ported from NitrOS-9 in order to unify the code base
  and bring non-6309 specific features to OS-9 Level Two.
- A bug in IOMan which affected any driver wanting to access the port
  address of its hardware via its path descriptor has been fixed.
- The montype command had a bug-fix and now shows the current monitor type if
  no parameters are given.  Also, the montype.hp file has been updated.
- The LogBook file in the SYS directory has been removed.
- A bug in the cputype command that caused crashing on a 6809 system
  has been fixed.

OS-9 Level Two V03.01.00:
- New common version among all releases of OS-9 for the CoCo
- Many commands have been updated and optimized:
   o For size reasons, command help information is no longer embedded in the
     utilites, but is instead available through the helpmsg file in /DD/SYS
   o date, dir, mdir, procs and verify now require a dash (-) before options
   o format now has a cluster option and now shows the correct number of
     good sectors on large sector devices
   o Numerous commands have been optimized for size
   o cmp, error, help and touch have been rewritten in assembly for size
   o copy has been enhanced to include OS-9/68K-like features
- VDGInt has been back-ported to OS-9 Level Two from NitrOS-9.  The
  vdgint.io module contains both CoCo 1/2 AND CoCo 3 graphics code.
  The vdgint_small.io module only contains CoCo 3 graphics code.
- CC3Go has been moved back into the root directory from the CMDS directory.
  This keeps ROM-based users and those who want cc3go in their bootfile from
  having to change the init module, which referenced CMDS/cc3go.
- CC3Go once again references /H0 and /H0/CMDS as paths that it tries to
  chd/chx to upon startup.  This allows for those with floppy boots who
  want to point /DD at their floppy to continue to do so.  Also, if the
  forking of 'shell startup' fails due to lack of a shell file, then
  CC3Go will now try to fork AutoEx instead of jumping to the crash routine.
- Several bugs that crept into IOMan during the last release have been fixed.

OS-9 Level Two V02.01.00 Beta2:
- Defs files now have properly terminated lines and 'pag' is now emitted
  as a comment.
- SCF, Rammer and PipeMan are now made from the NitrOS-9 version source base,
  bringing in new improvements and features from that platform.
- Clock and Clock2 are now unifed once again and are built from the same source
  base as the clocks from NitrOS-9.
- The printer driver is now for the CoCo 3 serial port.  In the previous
  release, it was mistakenly made for the Disto parallel port.
- ASM now assembles 6309 op-codes.
- Window descriptors now have proper initialization count.
- The debug program is now part of the CMDS package.
- With the inclusion of NitrOS-9's SCF, a bug which crashed the system when
  typing CTRL-E or CTRL-C while using shellplus has been fixed.
