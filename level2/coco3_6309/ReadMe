Package: OS-9 Level Two VR 03.00.02 Beta2
Release Date: January 5, 2003

This release of OS-9 Level Two for the Tandy Color Computer 3
represents the first community-based release since the discontinuation
of both OS-9 Level Two.  This release actually takes up where the
infamous "Level 2 Upgrade" left off, and incorporates most all of the
known features of that never-officially-released version of OS-9.

DISTRIBUTION
============
There are two double-sided 40 track DSK images ending in '_ds40_1.dsk',
and '_ds40_3.dsk' for disks 1 and 2, respectively.

USING THE DISK IMAGES
=====================
If you wish to transfer the disk images to a 5.25" or 3.5" floppy disk
for use with a real CoCo, and have a Linux system equipped with such a
disk drive unit, follow the steps below (root login is assumed):

1. Download and install the latest version of fdutils from
   http://fdutils.linux.lu/

2. Once installed, edit the /usr/local/etc/mediaprm file and add the
   following lines at the end of the file:

     "COCO360":
      DS DD sect=18 cyl=40 ssize=256 tpi=48 fm=0 gap=8

     "COCO720":
      DS DD sect=18 cyl=80 ssize=256 tpi=96 fm=0 gap=8

3. Insert your blank floppy into the drive on your Linux box.

4. Type the following command:

             setfdprm /dev/fd1 coco360    (360K 5.25" floppy disk)
                    OR
             setfdprm /dev/fd1 coco720    (720K 3.5" floppy disk)

   This assumes your floppy drive is /dev/fd1.  You may need to make
   adjustments to the above commands for your environment.

5. After typing the setfdprm command, the floppy drive unit should spin
   for a second then stop. Type this command:

             dd if=<diskimagefile> of=/dev/fd1

   Where <diskimagefile> is the image file you want to transfer to the
   floppy disk.  The image file transfer should start.  When it is done,
   take out the disk and try booting your CoCo with it.

Repeat steps 3-5 for each additional disk.
