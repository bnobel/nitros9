Fixed tOC_80d.txt file related to manhunter1.  The last line did not
have a return in it and was causing a segmentation fault when creating
the disk set.

Changed makefile(s) for kingsquest2, kingsquest3, kingsquest4,
leisuresuitlarry, manhunter1, and manhunter2 so that becker
boot disks for use with drivewire4 are created.

M rules.mak

Found that primary makefile was not compiling files in the "lib" folder.
Created a NOSLIB label in rules.mak for the full path to "lib" folder.
Replaced the "lib" folder name that was in primary makefile to use
the NOSLIB label to correct the problem with the makefile not branching
into the "lib" folder to compile its files"

M level1/modules/dwread.asm
M level1/modules/dwwrite.asm
M level1/modules/dw4read.asm
M level1/modules/dw4write.asm

Robert Gault found a problem related to the H6309-1 not always
functioning as expected.  Changed dwread.asm, dwwrite.asm, dw4read.asm
dw4write.asm to reflect these needed changes and movement of code to
correct locations.

In examining the dwwrite.asm source file found two sections of H6309-1 and
code that were the same.  This might have been root problem of the
compiling problems.  Verified both sections of code were identical before
removing second copy.

A scripts/burst

Got the burst script from Boisy that was needed for the web portal
on sourceforge. This script is located in the scripts folder.  Please
keep in mind that you will need to have this burst script on your
sourceforge ssh server account to do the "make nightly".

M rules.mak

Changed the dw3 format information in the rules.mak to use a single
sided format rather than double sided.  The double sided disk images
were preventing users booting off of the drivewire4 server using the
dw3 and becker boot disks.

Also updated the makefile related to the nightly build to use a
environment variable rather than boisy's fixed username.

At this time the upload of the zip file only works. Specific users ssh
account must have the burst script.

M level1/modules/kernel/krn.asm

Changed the GetMem rountine for Level1 krn. The routine compared
MaxMem against D.MLIM. This seemed to result in unwarranted loss
of memory and prevented at least one game, Interbank Incident, from running.
The comparison was removed resulting in an increase of available
memory. No problems have been noted.

AFAICT it will now build bootable .dsk's for all coco's
Running fine on my coco3, and on Roberts Coco3

-----------------------------------------------------
With switch to mercurial (Gene Heskett notes, 2012/11/03)

Level 2 builld, run tested
- joydrv_6551L broken, boot failed, no clue why, code didn't change
  Fixed now, works, 2012/11/07 GH

- All tc^3 drive descriptors broken, over write them in the .dsk's with known
  good versions before doing a mb!

Level 1 atari build
- fuji stuff build failed, assembler syntax error
  Fixed, builds but not run tested, I don't have a 6502 or Liber8 fitted atari

-----------------------------------------------------

Level 2 Only:

  has been fixed.  os9gen defaults to creating non-fragmented bootfiles, and
  the -e option must be used to create fragmented bootfiles.
- The init module has been extended to include the version string that was
  formerly in the Sysgo module.  Sysgo has been modified to print this string
  from the init module.

Level 2 Only:

- A bug which caused the system to crash during boot if grfdrv wasn't
  in the CMDS directory has been fixed.

------------------------------------------------------

NitrOS-9 V3.2.5:

Level 1 Only:
- Two new modules: CO51.io and term51.dt are available for 51x24 text

- CO80.io and term80.dt are no longer included in the repository, as
  there is no known supported hardware for these modules.

  Multi-Vue windowing functionality is not needed, in order to save system RAM.
- Changes in scf and grfdrv have resulted in faster text screen performance under
  NitrOS-9/6809 Level 2.
- A bug related to system memory allocation and DAT blocks has been fixed in krn.
- ioman now properly unlinks a device descriptor at I$Detach time.

- The mpi and megaread utilities have been added to the CMDS directory.
- The dmode utility has been updated.
- Several bugs in dsave's -b option have been fixed.
- sacia has been backported from Level 2 as sc6551.

Level 1 Only:
- Shell+ has been backported.
- vrn has been backported and the nil descriptor now requires vrn.
- nildrv has been removed.
- The F$PrsNam call has been fixed to allow 0-9 and _ as the first character

  improvements in extended output.

Level 1 Only:

- There are now two booters for booting from a WD1773 based
  floppy controller: boot_1773_6ms and boot_1773_30ms for
  6 and 30 millisecond step rates.
- The help utility has been enhanced to show help subjects if
  forked without any command line parameters.

Level 1 Only:
- Clock modules for Eliminator, Disto 2-N-1, Disto 4-N-1, Harris, and
  SmartWatch have been added (these are all UNTESTED.)  Also, the
  clock_bb clock module has been renamed to clock_bnb, and clock.60hz
  and clock.50hz have been renamed to clock_soft and clock_soft_50hz.

Level 2 Only:
- The M1 device descriptor now references the SACIA driver.

------------------------------------------------------

OS-9 V3.1.2:
- A bug in the help utility has been fixed.

  multiple subdirectories for better module organization.
- Booter modules for Burke & Burke, Disto RAMPak, Eliminator and

- rbf.mn has been back-ported from NitrOS-9 in order to unify the code base
  and bring non-6309 specific features to OS-9 Level Two.
- A bug in IOMan which affected any driver wanting to access the port
  address of its hardware via its path descriptor has been fixed.
- The montype command had a bug-fix and now shows the current monitor type if
  no parameters are given.  Also, the montype.hp file has been updated.

------------------------------------------------------

OS-9 V3.1.0:

- New common version among all releases of OS-9 for the CoCo
- Many commands have been updated and optimized:
   o For size reasons, command help information is no longer embedded in the
     utilites, but is instead available through the helpmsg file in /DD/SYS
   o date, dir, mdir, procs and verify now require a dash (-) before options
   o format now has a cluster option and now shows the correct number of
     good sectors on large sector devices
   o Numerous commands have been optimized for size
   o cputype, ded, devs, disasm, dmode and irqs have been added to the
     CMDS directory
   o cmp, error, help and touch have been rewritten in assembly for size
   o copy has been enhanced to include OS-9/68K-like features

Level 2 Only:
- VDGInt has been back-ported to OS-9 Level Two from NitrOS-9.  The
  vdgint.io module contains both CoCo 1/2 AND CoCo 3 graphics code.
  The vdgint_small.io module only contains CoCo 3 graphics code.
- CC3Go has been moved back into the root directory from the CMDS directory.
  This keeps ROM-based users and those who want cc3go in their bootfile from
  having to change the init module, which referenced CMDS/cc3go.
- CC3Go once again references /H0 and /H0/CMDS as paths that it tries to
  chd/chx to upon startup.  This allows for those with floppy boots who
  want to point /DD at their floppy to continue to do so.  Also, if the
  forking of 'shell startup' fails due to lack of a shell file, then
  CC3Go will now try to fork AutoEx instead of jumping to the crash routine.
- Several bugs that crept into IOMan during the last release have been fixed.

------------------------------------------------------

OS-9 V02.01.00 'Phoenix' Release (11/04/2002):

- Defs files now have properly terminated lines and 'pag' is now emitted
  as a comment.
- ASM now assembles 6309 op-codes

Level 1 Only:
- SYS/password now references /DD instead of /D0

Level 2 Only:
- SCF, Rammer and PipeMan are now made from the NitrOS-9 version source base,
  bringing in new improvements and features from that platform.
- Clock and Clock2 are now unifed once again and are built from the same source
  base as the clocks from NitrOS-9.
- The printer driver is now for the CoCo 3 serial port.  In the previous
  release, it was mistakenly made for the Disto parallel port.
- Window descriptors now have proper initialization count.
- The debug program is now part of the CMDS package.
- With the inclusion of NitrOS-9's SCF, a bug which crashed the system when
  typing CTRL-E or CTRL-C while using shellplus has been fixed.
