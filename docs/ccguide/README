About "See Also" references:
    In the reference entries there are a lot of references to other
    function calls. They should according to DocBook be implemented with
    the <function>-element, but this doesn't produce the desired result
    in my formatter. Instead the <link>-element has been used. In the
    future when a better formatter is available, you can replace
	<link linkend="creat">creat()</link>,
    with
	<function moreinfo="refentry">creat</function>,
