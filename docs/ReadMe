Welcome to the OS-9 documentation effort. The motivation behind scanning
and reissuing the documentation is that without documentation no new
users will discover OS-9. This little operating system is more than 20
years old, and we want it to be here for at least another 20 years.

We have therefore tried to find the most durable and rich format
for documents possible. DocBook is more than 10 years old. Older than
MS-Word. It began in 1991 as a joint project of HaL Computer Systems and
O'Reilly. It will very likely be around in 2020 also.  If it isn't it is
a text-based format, so it is possible to reverse-engineer and convert
the format.

To create HTML, PDF or PostScript you must have these RPMs installed on
your RedHat system:

docbook-dtd41-sgml
sgml-common
docbook-utils
docbook-utils-pdf
tetex-dvips
tetex
jadetex
