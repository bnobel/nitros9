<para>
This command sets the system date and time, then activates the real
time clock. The date and time can be entered as parameters, or if no
parameters are given, <command>setime</command> will issue a prompt. Numbers are one
or two decimal digits using space, colon, semicolon or slash
delimiters. OS-9 system time uses the 24 hour clock, i.e., 1520 is
3:20 PM.
</para>
<para>
IMPORTANT NOTE: This command must be executed before OS-9 can
perform multitasking operations. If the system does not have a real
time clock this command should still be used to set the date for the
file system.
</para>
<para>
SYSTEMS WITH BATTERY BACKED UP CLOCKS: <command>Setime</command> should still be run to
start time-slicing, but only the <emphasis>year</emphasis> need be given,
the date and time will be read from the clock.
