COCO OS-9 SOURCE PROJECT

This project was started some years ago by Boisy Pitre, and Alan DeKok.
The idea was to create a well documented repository of OS-9 Level One and
Level Two source code for the Color Computer.

That goal has largely been reached, though there are still modules that have
yet to be disassembled and properly commented.  Also, other source files
need additional commenting.

FILE ORGANIZATION
All source files contain the file extension '.asm'  The source files are
organized into their respective directories, with the topmost being:

	level1/       ..... OS-9 Level One V2 source
	level2/       ..... OS-9 Level Two V2 source
	level2v3/     ..... OS-9 Level Two V3 source
	defs/         ..... OS-9 definition files
	3rdparty/     ..... Third party drivers, applications, etc.

The level1/, level2/, and level3/ directories contain makefiles and
subdirectories for commands, modules and bootfiles.

DEFINITION FILES
The defs/ directory has definition files for the OS-9 packages.

	os9defs       ..... Defs files for level1/ and level2/
	os9defs.l2v3  ..... Defs files for level2v3/
	systype.l1    ..... Defs files for level1/
	systype.l2    ..... Defs files for level2/ and level2v3/
	scfdefs       ..... SCF file manager defs
	rbfdefs       ..... RBF file manager defs
	pipedefs      ..... PipeMan defs for level1/ and level2/
	pipedefs.l2v3 ..... PipeMan defs for level2v3/
	l51.defs      ..... Used by level2v3/
	l52.defs      ..... Used by level2v3/

BUILDING
The provided makefiles use the os9tools package, which can be found at
www.sourceforge.net, in order to assemble source files into binary modules.
Simply type 'make' at the project's root directory to assemble.
