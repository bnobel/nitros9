THE NITROS-9 PROJECT

This project was started some years ago by Boisy Pitre and Alan DeKok.
The idea was to create a well documented repository of NitrOS-9 source
code for the Color Computer.

That goal has largely been reached, though there are still modules that have
yet to be disassembled and properly commented.  Also, other source files
need additional commenting.

FILE ORGANIZATION
All source files contain the file extension '.asm'  The source files are
organized into their respective directories, with the topmost being:

	docs/         ..... NitrOS-9 Documentation
	6809l1/       ..... NitrOS-9/6809 Level 1 source
	6809l2/       ..... NitrOS-9/6809 Level 2 source
	6309l2/       ..... NitrOS-9/6309 Level 2 source
	6309l3/       ..... NitrOS-9/6309 Level 3 source
	defs/         ..... NitrOS-9 definition files
	3rdparty/     ..... Third party drivers, applications, etc.

The 6x09l?/ directories contain makefiles and subdirectories for commands,
modules and bootfiles.

DEFINITION FILES
The defs/ directory has definition files for the NitrOS-9 packages. These 
these defs/ files are also the basis for the definition files that are
migrated to the distribution disks.

	os9defs       ..... Defs files for all NitrOS-9 distributions
	systype       ..... System definitions for all NitrOS-9 distributions
	scfdefs       ..... SCF file manager defs
	rbfdefs       ..... RBF file manager defs
	vdgdefs       ..... VDGInt driver defs
	pipedefs      ..... PipeMan defs

BUILDING
The provided makefiles use the cocotools package, which can be found at
<http://www.nitros9.org/snapshots/cocotools.tar.gz>, in order to assemble
source files into binary modules. Simply type 'make' at the project's root
directory to assemble.
