COCO OS-9 SOURCE PROJECT

This project was started some years ago by Boisy Pitre, and Alan DeKok.
The idea was to create a well documented repository of OS-9 Level One and
Level Two source code for the Color Computer.

That goal has largely been reached, though there are still modules that have
yet to be disassembled and properly commented.  Also, other source files
need additional commenting.

FILE ORGANIZATION
All source files contain the file extension '.asm'  The source files are
organized into their respective directories, with the topmost being:

	docs/         ..... OS-9 Documentation
	level1/       ..... OS-9 Level One source
	level2/       ..... OS-9 Level Two source
	nlevel2/      ..... NitrOS-9 Level Two source
	nlevel3/      ..... NitrOS-9 Level Three source
	defs/         ..... OS-9 definition files
	3rdparty/     ..... Third party drivers, applications, etc.

The level1/, level2/, nlevel2/ and nlevel3/ directories contain makefiles and
subdirectories for commands, modules and bootfiles.

DEFINITION FILES
The defs/ directory has definition files for the OS-9 packages.  Note that
these defs/ files are not intended for distribution disks, only for building
on the host.

	os9defs       ..... Defs files for all OS-9 packages
	systype       ..... System definitions for all OS-9 packages
	scfdefs       ..... SCF file manager defs
	rbfdefs       ..... RBF file manager defs
	vdgdefs       ..... VDGInt driver defs
	pipedefs      ..... PipeMan defs

BUILDING
The provided makefiles use the os9tools package, which can be found at
www.sourceforge.net, in order to assemble source files into binary modules.
Simply type 'make' at the project's root directory to assemble.
